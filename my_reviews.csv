Jena,5,5,5,4,2024-11-30,"Fantastic service and food.  Great dinner, but noise level is high."
Claire,4,3,5,5,2024-11-30,"A great place to have a birthday! Thank you, I will be returning. The food was good, the overall vibe of the restaurant was good. Our server was excellent."
Chris,3,3,4,3,2024-11-28,"Very loud, drinks and service were great, food was good to average but so not worth the price vs. what you can get elsewhere.  This is the 3rd try over the past 3 yrs and it continues to validate our assessment that price are 2x the value.  It's over-rated and just good not great."
Debra,5,5,5,5,2024-11-26,We live Carmines! Always delicious and wonderful waitstaff!!!!
Sam,4,5,5,3,2024-11-23,"ALEX was incredible! He was very cordial, professional, debonair, knowledgeable, helpful, and truly caring about our experience!"

Jennifer,5,5,5,5,2024-11-20,Our first time visiting Carmines. Food was delicious and service was amazing! Definitely would be back again.
Susan,5,5,5,5,2024-11-20,Great patio ceiling heaters.  Loved the quiet garden atmosphere on the patio.  Halibut was delicious.
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,4,2024-11-17,"great food and great service! Only critique is that tables are very close together which causes noise volume to be loud- especially when my two top is sat between two large 5+ seat tables.
Will definitely be back!"
Angela,5,5,5,5,2024-11-15,Fantastic service.  Delicious food.  Wonderful surroundings.  Perfection!
karan,5,5,5,5,2024-11-13,Again always great food and service. Hooked on meatballs. Best place to enjoy a casual long lunch
Regan,5,5,5,5,2024-11-10,"It was a lovely meal, with excellent service.  We will be back."
Steve,5,5,5,5,2024-11-08,Carmines is one of our favorite restaurants.  The food is always great.  The staff is wonderful.  We always enjoy our time there.  We will be back in a few weeks.  Highly recommend it.
Bill,5,5,5,5,2024-11-06,"We had an excellent lunch today and we brought in an old California Cabernet Sauvignon.  They immediately offer to decant it for us and of course we shared a glass of the wine with the waitperson.   Food and service were terrific, and we are looking forward to our next visit."
Al,4,5,4,5,2024-11-03,"My first time here. Food, atmosphere and bar experience was great. What wasn’t so great was our experience with our waitor. Did not make us feel welcome and made us feel rushed. Without introduction or summarizing the specials, he just said “are you ready to order?”
Because we didnt want to reward bad behavior with our tip, we requested a new waitor and she was wonderful! Without telling her of our experience she gave an introduction, summarized the specials, and gave us her recommendations. Overall good. Because everyone other than the first waitor was great, it’s not a reflection of the establishment. Will return again."
Craig,4,5,5,4,2024-11-03,Food and service were excellent.  Noise level was super high and lighting was very low to the point that one of us had trouble reading his menu and seeing his food ( does have vision problems).
Eddie,5,5,5,5,2024-11-02,Fantastic service and good as always. Thank you Carmines
Melody,5,5,4,5,2024-11-02,"Go hungry and be prepared for a fabulous meal! The Caprese, Caesar, Linguini Vongole, and Salmon pasta dishes were exceptional as was the fresh warm bread basket. The wine was also very good. We had a great bottle during our previous visit however this time, we only wanted a glass to accompany our meal. Since the wine could only be purchased by the bottle, our server brought us a couple of samples to try. Kudos for going the extra mile! He described it as local and fairly priced. Our mistake because we didn’t ask the price…yikes…it was $25/ glass. Wont be doing that again!"
Monique,5,5,5,5,2024-09-26,"Celebrated my mom’s 66th birthday at Carmines with our toddler in tow. Carmine’s host seated us promptly and our server couldn’t have been nicer and more accommodating. Each item we ordered was brought out in a timely manner, beautiful presentation and tasted delicious. Standouts for us were the Caesar salad, gambaroni and cioppino. Can’t go wrong with tiramisu for dessert."
Jamie,5,5,5,5,2024-09-26,Amazing as always! The gnocchi is the best ever! I wish I could come here every day.
Stephanie,5,5,5,5,2024-09-22,"Tremendous experience. We came to celebrate my mom’s birthday and had an amazing time from start to finish. Everyone was very accommodating, friendly, and we can’t wait to come back!

Items ordered:
-Prosciutto con melone (appetizer)
-Extra dirty grey goose martini with blue cheese olives. If you love blue cheese like I do, these are a must!
- Risotto Tiberio. Ive had this here before and it was so amazing. Perfectly cheesy and fluffy with generous servings of seafood.
- Crab Rigatoni - so creamy and the crab was just perfection.
- Spaghetti di finochio + meatball. Trust me the meatball is worth it! It’s stuffed with cheese and just so good. That you can get a la carte! The spaghetti was so good with a delicious creamy pesto.
- Tiramisu and Bourbon Bread pudding were also amazing!"
ADRIANN,5,5,5,5,2024-09-20,"Beautiful ambiance, great service. Does time there for anniversary and they treated us well!"
Linh,5,5,5,4,2024-09-16,The sautéed squid appetizer was so well balanced and flavorful.
Teresa,5,5,5,5,2024-09-11,"Wonderful food and service.  Always friendly, knowledgeable people.  These servers are top notch!"
Jeri,5,5,5,5,2024-09-11,We have eaten at Carmines multiple time’s.   Each and every time has been a fantastic experience.  Our server Matthew was absolutely fantastic last night.  Could not have had a better dinner.  Thank you so much.
YongChul,5,5,5,5,2024-09-11,"It was a fantastic lunch. Filet mignon came with the daily special salad was out of heaven. Cod chowder and ragu with rigatoni were very hearty. The server was attentive and helpful. Somewhat unimpressed were NA cocktail berry spritz and NY steak which I had to put more salt to taste.

Overall a very good experience. I am very happy that I finally tried Carmine's today and will definitely revisit soon."
S. Rogers,5,5,4,4,2024-09-08,Carmine’s continues to be THE EXAMPLE of how to EXCEED EXPECTATIONS!!!! Been a devout patron for years.  Never disappointed!!!!
Melody,5,5,5,5,2024-09-07,"Exceptional experience! We dined on the well landscaped patio which provided privacy despite being busy.  Jeff was our server & he provided helpful suggestions especially since it was our first visit to Carmines.  Our meal was fresh and beautifully presented. Each course from the wine, caprese & Caesar salads, halibut,linguini vongole, and desserts was just perfect! We look forward to returning another day."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-09-06,"Always excellent, Roberto runs a tight and excellent ship! Carl B"
Kristi,5,5,5,2,2024-09-06,"It was a very hot day in the PNW (90degrees) and the restaurant had their doors open. If the air conditioning was on it wasn’t keeping up. It just made things uncomfortable. The food and service was amazing, it was just very hot!"
Scot,5,5,5,5,2024-08-31,Carmine’s is exceptional. A classic with modern edge in the heart of Bellevue. Love sitting at the sidewalk corner table and watching all the action with tasty bits and drinks. Tremendous favorite for  lunch.
Anne,5,5,5,5,2024-08-29,There staff was amazing. We don't live here but I'd come back for sure when we visit again. Perfect risotto. Amazing halibut
Beverly,5,5,5,5,2024-08-28,"Our waiter was fabulous. He was extremely attentive and had great suggestions for what we might like. It was a delicious meal with impeccable service as always, and a wonderful atmosphere."
Tamikah,5,5,5,5,2024-08-25,The evening was great!! Our server was knowledgeable of the menus and the specials. She was very attentive and well informed. The food and atmosphere was phenomenal! My husband and I will definitely be dining at Carmine’s again.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-08-24,Celebrated anniversary
Ania,5,5,5,5,2024-08-24,The best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best!!!!!!!!!!!
Jennifer,3,3,3,4,2024-08-23,"Lunch for my friend's birthday with her elderly mother from out-of-town. Expectations were high based on past dining experiences. We had La CapreseBuffala mozzarella for appetizer, tomatoes were heirloom quality, their house bread (with the perfect chew factor IMO) was offered multiple times,  although I wished it was warmed, the butter was soft; the best part of lunch was the d Cream of cauliflower Gratinée, delicious, flavorful, rich, but not overly so. Entrees were Clam Linguine, with a generous portion of clams, Caesar Salad, nicely prepared and Spaghetti Ortolano, was lackluster, I think they forgot to toss in the olive oil.  The two desserts were both worth every bite: tiramisu (in fact I took an additional slice home) and lemon meringue was Instagram worthy. 

Lunch is not usually the best showing for any fine restaurant and that needs to be taken into consideration. The restaurant itself is impeccably cared for, clean, bright, beautiful. The experience was not as hoped for, no mention of celebrating a special occasion, even though I had noted it. I will say the owner called me after I left a note about the experience and I do believe this less than 5 star experience was an anomaly. I will go back and still cannot think of another restaurant in Seattle that I'd rather have a special meal."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-08-22,We celebrated our Anniversary. Carmine’s was a great choice!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-08-22,"I highly recommend this establishment, everything is very tasty and beautiful"
Ania,5,5,5,5,2024-08-22,Exquisite experience. I heard they’re opening a new downtown Seattle location on 5th and Pike. Can’t wait for that.
Susie,5,5,5,5,2024-08-20,Oh my God Carmine’s is always so noisy when it’s full of fabulous people. Our waitress Kat was amazing super sweet food was delicious as always.
Jeffrey ,5,5,5,5,2024-08-20,"Carmines in Bellevue is excellent.  We had a dinner reservation just as they opened for dinner.  They grew very busy throughout our dinner, but service did not diminish.  Food and beverage was excellent, aw was location and price. We were there for our anniversary, but will return before the next one."
Dee,5,5,5,5,2024-08-18,"We came here for my friends bachelorette party…
SERVICE: Impeccable. They were able to change my reservation and squeeze us in at an earlier time. They had a congratulations card waiting for her at the table. The staff were all congratulating her throughout the night. And they brought her a complimentary piece of tiramisu cake with Congratulations written in cursive with chocolate 
FOOD: Delectable. Their pastas were delicious and the dessert 10/10. I had the pesto fettuccini with prawns and devoured my meal
AMBIENCE: Romantically Elegant. I recommend this for dates, celebrations, special occasions, birthdays. Candle and fresh flowers at the tables."
karan,5,5,5,5,2024-08-16,Always great food and service they cannot do enough for you
RebeccaS,5,5,5,5,2024-08-11,"The ambiance was beautiful, the service first class and food was delicious with reasonably priced dishes for a special night out."

Lynn,4,5,5,4,2024-08-10,Carmines delivers an elegant setting with wonderful service! I love the daily fresh specials that are recommended by the waiters. The homemade dessert selection was amazing as are the wine pairings.
Michael,5,5,5,5,2024-08-09,"Outstanding service and food.  Very pricey, however, it was a special occasion."
Cathy,5,5,5,4,2024-08-06,Carmine’s is first class dining all the way.  Our server was outstanding…the food was amazing.  However…sitting inside is LOUD.  And I’d love a hint on how to reserve a good table on a Monday evening — in the notes I wrote this was a BIG birthday for me and the first table we were shown was marginal at best in a walk way…we settled on a table still in a walk way and servers without apology kept bumping into my chair….sigh.
JeanneB,5,5,5,5,2024-08-03,"Dinner was superb ! Absolute perfection from start to finish. What a wonderful way to celebrate my birthday!
Thank you Steven for being such an attentive and professional wait person."
Teresa,4,5,5,3,2024-08-03,"Excellent food and good service.  However - don’t go if it’s a hot day in Bellevue. Inside the dining room was so uncomfortably hot, it took away our appetite.  (Apparently they have no AC.).  Typically at this restaurant, we give all 5 star reviews.  This was definitely NOT our normal experience at Carmine’s."
Steve,3,3,3,4,2024-08-03,"A frequent diner at Carmines. This trip was really average.  Felt like server was in a big hurry, gluten free pasta not good.  Super Tuscan wine was outstanding.  Felt very overpriced for the quality of the meal."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-08-03,"The service, quality of the food, thoughtful preparation and taste were exceptional.  Our server, Alberto G, made our day even more special with amazing service and a great personality."
MeganD,5,5,5,5,2024-07-30,"Dinner was lovely and our entire experience was fabulous. We had the cioppino, veal scallopine, lobster special and the rigatoni bolognese and all were excellent. Service was also superb led by Matthew!  Thanks to the entire team at Carmine’s for making a special occasion even more remarkable."
IvanB,5,5,5,5,2024-07-30,Just excellent! You won't be disappointed with a meal here!
Lkelly616,5,5,5,5,2024-07-26,"Carmine's was excellent as usual!  The ambiance is inviting, the food was delicious and the service
was very attentive!  Went there with 3 friends to celebrate one of their birthdays.  We all enjoyed our meals very much.  The eggplant parmegiana, the salmon special and a shrimp dish were all expertly prepared and presented.  The complementary piece of Tiramisu to celebrate my friend's birthday was a nice gesture too."
MarisaB,4,3,5,4,2024-07-21,"Could be better.
I guess the restaurant is so famous that is not trying to be better.
Service was good although hostess was on the phone for 3 minutes or more while we were waiting.
Veal meat was not tender, that dish needs to get better."
JaiV,5,5,5,5,2024-07-20,"It was the perfect setting for a summer birthday celebration for our family.The service was exceptional especially by our server Alexei, and we will definitely be back!"
DavidS,5,5,5,4,2024-07-20,A bit noisy and proxy but excellent food and service
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-07-19,"Absolutely amazing, to be honest for the price the atmosphere, location and food it was well worth any check. Would definitely recommend 100% to anyone who loves fine dining and a great atmosphere. Will be going back."
ChristineA,4,3,5,3,2024-07-17,"Update to my initial review….Roberto from the restaurant followed up from my poor review and experience and expressed that they wanted to make it right.  They credited the meal off my bill and offered a gift card on my next visit.  This was certainly great customer follow thru and they went above and beyond to show they really care. Thank you to Roberto and Carmines on great customer service!

Initial review….I ordered the double bone-in pork chop and it was very dry!  I was very disappointed in the quality."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-07-17,Our server Matthew was exceptional.  Everything was top notch.
oliver,5,5,5,5,2024-07-16,"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE UNITED STATES! Seriously, you cannot find better service, better food, better ambience elsewhere. Praise be to this institution."
Julia,5,5,5,5,2024-07-16,"An amazing experience from the moment you enter through the beautiful patio. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and offered many great suggestions for myself as I am gluten and diary free. 

The decor makes me feel like I am in Italy! Super romantic. Great for a date night or celebrations with friends and family. I noticed a lot of large parties on a Monday evening. Even the bar was packed. Loved my experience here and cannot wait to try out their other restaurants in Seattle. Thank you for making my boyfriend's birthday so special!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-07-16,The best restaurant on the east side. Carmine’s never disappoints. We truly love our dining experience here
Mark,4,5,4,4,2024-07-16,"The bartender was amiable and immediately inquired whether we wanted just drinks or dinner too. We were waiting for our table so we just had drinks. When we finished them, we returned to the host stand and were promptly seated. The service was good. The food was delicious. I asked the server about a dessert cheese plate I saw online. She confirmed they would be able to accommodate me. We had a melon with prosciutto, salad, soup, lobster risotto instead of crab, cioppino, key lime pie, the cheese plate and then tiramisu with a candle for her birthday."
Edward,5,5,5,5,2024-07-14,"This is one of our most favorite restaurants, the food and service is always outstanding."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-07-14,Carmine’s is my wife and my go to for celebrating special occasion’s.  Everything is always top notch.
GregB,5,5,5,5,2024-07-13,The service and food was excellent as always. One of the very best restaurants.
OpenTable Diner,3,2,3,5,2024-07-13,"I invited several friends.  I wasn’t impressed but the special risotto.  It was salty, the meat was tough, and the consistency wasn’t to standard. Very disappointing.  I hardly touched my plate.  The bread is good.  Appetizer shrimp was great.  The rest of the food was an agree."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-07-11,Food and service are always impeccable. We will be back.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2024-07-10,I am always pleased with the food and always great service.

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-07-07,Amazing food and service. Beautiful setting and great atmosphere.
OpenTable Diner,3,1,1,3,2024-07-06,"A little disappointing as we decided to spend our 11 year anniversary at one at our favorite restaurants.🍝

Table wasn’t prepared, even though I made a note of our anniversary a while ago ￼￼(last second signage, no candle, etc)🥺😩

We never received bread until we asked for it after the food came and when we did it was cold (at this point I’m unsure if it’s suppose to be warm or cold due to inconsistencies) 🤷🏾‍♂️

My order was over cooked, with mushy pasta and a hard ￼boiled egg. 🥚

Please note this review is only from our experience specifically last night. We love Carmines and the staff  ❤️"
GustavoD,5,5,5,5,2024-07-06,"The occasion was just a date lunch with my wife. This was our first time here and we loved the place. Every thing was right. The food options were plenty, food was great, service attentive. We definitely will be coming back."
karanD,5,5,5,5,2024-07-05,Always great food always great service would highly recommend it

HinaP,5,5,5,5,2024-06-29,We had a wonderful family dinners at Carmines Bellevue - Steven and the team did an excellent job.  We shall return!
kcfoodie,5,4,5,5,2024-06-27,"We had a lovely dinner to celebrate a birthday. The service is beyond excellent. The food is also extraordinary. However, I ordered a dish with squid pasta and decidedly did not like it. I didn’t notice it on the menu, but I wish I would have been ordered a choice of pasta to alert me it was different. Not only did I not enjoy the taste but it was soggy and had a distinct smell. I should say emphatically that everyone else had an outstanding meal!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-06-26,"Carmines never disappoints.  Always fresh, super clean, excellent service, and outstanding food.  Love the place!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2024-06-22,"Great food , excellent service. Specials little bit too expensive . Overall one of the better places in Bellevue."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-06-22,"Alfredo, our server is the best
Food was outstanding!
Everything = perfect!"
Scotchmo,5,5,3,4,2024-06-22,The patio table near the bar is a great people watching spot … but only having the bartender as server and mixologist led to some delays in ordering and attentive service. A slight adjustment to having at least one busboy checking more often could help. The food was delicious; the cauliflower gratine was superb; an excellent lunch; looking forward to returning.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-06-19,Absolutely amazing Service and Food .. all positive…
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2024-06-18,Great place to celebrate graduation! Server was great. Didnt feel rushed at all. Enjoyed the evening.

JosephO,5,5,5,5,2024-06-12,"Our steak was a bit underdone, they offered to redo it. We declined so they comped us dessert.
Very loud where we were seated!"
KristieT,5,5,5,5,2024-06-09,"From the time we step into the restaurant, we had excellent service. Our server was very nice and helped us make good decisions ordering since it was our first time there. The food was delicious and homemade pasta was delicious! Since it was my birthday they gave me a slice of tiramisu for dessert which was perfect for the two of us after our meal because the portions were filling. We said we will definitely go back."

Bill,5,5,5,5,2024-05-18,Outstanding service today. Our waitress was the best. Keep us updated on the specials.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-05-17,Just outstanding.  The best of the best.  Mamma Mia.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-05-15,Pleasant atmosphere and amazingly attentive staff. A very rich wine list. There are only pleasant thoughts left.
JWo888,5,5,5,5,2024-05-14,"We enjoyed lunch with wonderful service to celebrate a friend’s birthday.  Each of the items that we ordered was delicious: panzanella salad, lentil soup, minestrone soup and eggplant parmigiana.  Carmine’s is one of my favorite restaurants, because the food and service are always outstanding."
johnm,5,5,5,5,2024-05-13,"Food was excellent as always. Matthew, our server, was extremely knowledgeable."
tomw,5,5,5,5,2024-05-13,"We choose Carmine's for all the special occasions. We went for Mother's Day and everything was superb (as always). Our server, Ron was so wonderful. He was so attentive and so kind to our 9-year-old son. After we ordered wine, our son wanted a soda, but we wouldn't allow another sugary drink since he already had one during the day. Ron suggested some lemon wedges to put in his water to make it extra special & that did the trick, our son was thrilled.

Ron told us about the daily specials and made great recommendations. I mentioned that I wanted to try something new since I always get the crab risotto or the veal. Ron said the halibut was really good, and that they do halibuts really well. It came with on a bed of parmesan risotto with saffron sauce and some veggies. I love their risottos (crab, lobster etc) so I decided on this dish, my husband followed. We absolutely loved it! If you love caesar salad like we do, Carmine's have one of the best caesars around! The dressing has a hint of green like pesto, makes it extra special. They always make up a special plate (kids portion) for our son (spaghetti with one big meatball). They are pretty good about making up a special plate that is not on the menu. Our son once wanted a pepperoni pizza and they made it for him.

We just love this place! Thanks for making our Mother's Day meal special Ron!"
DianeKK,5,5,5,5,2024-05-09,Everyone here was gracious and wonderful to work with. The food was superb and the ambience magnificent!
Amanda,5,5,5,5,2024-05-07,"Excellent burrata special. Delicious! The food and service are always great. Lunch if 2 salads, an appetizer and 2 glasses of wine for $185 is a bit much."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-05-05,"Food and service are excellent and genuine.  I appreciated the unenforced tips policy.  With such classy and genuine services, I am happy to tip above average to show my party’s appreciation.  It’s a pleasure to dine and entertain at Carmine’s each and every time."
OpenTable Diner,2,2,2,4,2024-05-03,We didn’t quite enjoy our lunch. We came in with high expectation and both service and dishes were not meeting it.
Opentablediner,5,5,5,5,2024-05-03,"food service atmosphere, all top shelf.
they don’t advertise.. they don’t need to .. those in the know , know.
Hard to get a reservation.. book ahead"
oliver,5,5,5,5,2024-05-03,"One of the best restaurants on the West Coast. Service that makes you feel special, food that brings you straight back to Italy."
JoeW,5,5,5,4,2024-05-03,"The food is outstanding, the service was great.  Nice Restaurant and has always been good!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-05-03,"The best restaurant on the east side and potentially in all of the city. I love it here. Feels like home, delicious food, elegant and non obtrusive service, in a beautiful setting. Not much more you can ask for."
Bluewa,5,5,5,5,2024-05-02,"Luxury dining experience.
Everything is to the nines.
Serene"
SteveD,5,5,4,3,2024-05-01,"The food is consistently good.  (The Bellevue location is every bit as good as Pioneer Square).  The only thing I would fault is that the service seemed a bit rushed.  It wasn't because they needed the tables, I was eating late.  But I don't expect to be out of there in an hour when I am eating food of that quality."
Erinb,4,5,5,5,2024-04-30,"Lovely, though front of house experience was not fluid…"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-04-26,"Everything was perfect the food the ambiance @ specially the waiter Jeff he was super good. 
And the gesture of the restaurant when they know it’s our anniversary. I recommend the restaurant it’s a 5 stars."
OpenTable Diner,1,1,2,2,2024-04-25,"$75 for a lobster pasta?! It was the special (price was not mentioned - shame on us for not asking, I guess)."
OpenTable Diner,4,4,5,4,2024-04-25,"Food and service were wonderful as

CesarK,5,5,5,4,2024-04-23,"Best Italian in the eastside. Great, food and service!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-04-20,"Amazing food, great service. Halibut was cooked to perfection. Served made great suggestions!"
madison1223,1,1,1,4,2024-04-19,Server very pushy and intense. No time to even chat - like we had to know what to order almost immediately with him coming back within a few minutes. Was there for a business meeting and it was not productive with the constant nagging. I won’t return. This used to be a favorite.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-04-18,"Best restaurant in the PNW, very consistent and the best service in Seattle"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2024-04-18,"First time eating here and the experience was great. Matthew was our waiter and he was on point, very thorough, attentive and polite."
SusanB,5,5,5,5,2024-04-17,"Our first time at Carmine's after hearing glowing comments from others. Did not disappoint. It was a birthday for us and Carmine's staff helped us feel special in our celebration. We had a truly delicious meal, outstanding service and great recommendations from our server. Will definitely dine at Carmine's again....we live an hour away...and only wish we lived closer."
DanielD,5,5,5,5,2024-04-17,If you are a fan of Il Terrazzo in Seattle you will be excited to discover a very similar experience in Bellevue.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2024-04-17,Just too noisy -& wanted to be on at area but was told that we had to connect with the restaurant directly but we loved Carmines so it’s all good
JillG,5,5,5,5,2024-04-14,"Fantastic food, atmosphere and service! Ally was our waitress and she was INCREDIBLE!  She made the birthday celebration extra special!!!"
OpenTable Diner,4,4,1,4,2024-04-13,Service was a bit slow and not the best for the price.
OpenTable Diner,3,5,1,2,2024-04-13,The food is amazing. The service was not. There was a wedding party of 40 which created a tremendous amount of noise and our waiter focused his attention on them and neglected us. Very disappointed for our first time there.
BobS,5,5,5,5,2024-04-12,One of my favorites in Bellevue. Excellent for business lunches and evening dining with friends.
KevinN,5,5,5,4,2024-04-09,Loud but great food and service. We definitely would go back.
jane,5,5,5,5,2024-04-07,"As usual, the food and service did not disappoint.  This is why we continue to return."
anne,5,5,5,4,2024-04-05,Waiters have knowledgeable recommendations and want you to enjoy yourself. The food is always great and tried a new dessert.  An Italian vanilla cake w marscapone and meringue on top.  Great and unusual!
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,5,2024-04-05,"Reservation wasn't easy they seem to be booked up for many of the times w tried to reserve.
Parking is a bit confusing but worked very well once figured out, you enter from a side street and they validated no issue.
Seated quickly and wait staff was great and very quick to refill beverages.
Food was good "" Osso Buco"" is what we came for and it was good but I wouldn't order it again and the others at the table said the food was good too. "" Good too"" is another way of saying OK however not amazing! The prices are a little pricey but we have paid more for worse.
We give the highest marks to the wait staff....Attention to detail was amazing.
After about an hour it did get noisy in our opinion.
The best way for us to reward a restaurant is to say WE WILL BE BACK,"
DavidMB,5,5,5,5,2024-04-04,"In a word: fantastic. The service was friendly, polite, and efficient. The ambiance was lovely, although as noted on the noise level question, there were numerous, ummm, lively conversations throughout the restaurant. The food, however, was the highlight and was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Anatra Arosto Alle Ciliege (dry-aged duck) medium and the cook was spot-on. My fiancée ordered the fish special, which in this case was lightly battered halibut, and said that hers was perfect as well. They also surprised us with a congratulatory dessert in celebration of our upcoming nuptials. 

Carmine's is not inexpensive, but it is worth every penny."
JeanneB,5,5,5,5,2024-03-29,Wonderful meal with delightful service. Makes any meal feel  like a celebration
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-03-29,Legacy family restaurant continues to impress. Our waiter Matthew was outstanding. Food and bev spot on as usual.
Foodie168,5,5,5,5,2024-03-28,Delicious halibut special and filet mignon was excellent too. Appreciate Carmine’s takes into account my gluten free and low carb needs. My filet mignon came with extra veggies instead of risotto or pasta like I asked for. Thanks.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-03-24,"Carmine’s never disappoints! Impeccable service, outstanding cocktails, and delicious food. Every time."
OpenTable Diner,3,5,2,4,2024-03-23,"We went to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. We were a group of 5 with an 8 pm reservation. While the food was incredible, our server couldn’t have been more snide and inattentive. He greeted us, asked about drinks and walked away before we could order because my daughter asked about mocktails. He came back about 20 minutes later and we ordered drinks, a bottle of wine and appetizers. Our appetizers were delivered before our wine was opened. He just left the unopened bottle of wine on the table. We were nearly 50 minutes into our reservation time before the wine was opened and served.

I’ve never spent $600 on a dinner to be treated so poorly. The consensus across the board was excellent food (except the crab risotto which was fishy),beautiful and festive atmosphere, but not worth being treated like we’re beneath another person.

Edit: The owners from Carmine contacted me this morning. They could not have been more apologetic about our experience, and we had a wonderful conversation. While it’s disappointing to have a bad experience, I really appreciate the way they handled it and we would return again."
LauraK,3,3,4,4,2024-03-22,"We tried the vongole and the rib eye/risotto special. The food was good, but it was too salty for my taste. I even requested less salt, but it was still too much."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-03-21,What a gem in the heart of Bellevue. Old fashioned charm and classic elevated Itallian.
Travelerswife,5,5,5,5,2024-03-15,Always excellent food and service:) our go to place!
TeresaH,5,5,5,5,2024-03-14,"Server was friendly, knowledgeable and professional."

Suzanne,5,5,5,5,2024-03-12,Service…food was outstanding…we eat in bar…bartended/ service made it a fun experience.
DaltonB,5,5,5,5,2024-03-10,All the food was fantastic. Very well timed courses as well. The crab risotto was insanely good and the basque cheesecake to end was great (although would recommend without the berry compote).
Walter,5,5,5,5,2024-03-09,"Everything that we ordered was excellent. The Bison raviolli would only get a 7.5 as they where a little dry and didn't have a fresh side.
On the other hand the ginochi and steak were the best I have ever had.
Steak tartar as appetizer was superb."
AlisaG,5,5,5,5,2024-03-09,"I usually dread dining in downtown Bellevue due to lack of service, especially at the hostess stand but was amazed at how friendly and polished the staff at Carmine’s was end to end. Thank you Carmine’s for making my daughter’s 18 birthday special."
Bill,5,5,5,5,2024-03-06,"Food was very good and appreciated the waitstaff, especially the wine person, Alfredo.  Very knowledgeable and was quick to decant our wine as requested."

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-02-29,A great celebration for a friend birthday and amazing atmosphere.
Fablok,5,5,5,5,2024-02-29,"We had a leisurely lunch that lasted two hours.  No one rushed us, and we got great service.  The antipasti platter was plenty for the four of us. We shared the delicious venison ravioli, and perfectly cooked scallops that were on the special menu.  We got two desserts to share. The bread pudding was warm, not too heavy, and paired with some delicious ice cream.  My favorite though was the Meyer lemon tart.  A perfect end to a lovely meal."
JimP,5,5,5,5,2024-02-28,"Our server Cat was amazingly professional and fun. The food, as always, was to die for. Love this restaurant!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2024-02-24,"Great service from hostess to manager to waiter.    Food was equally as good from appetizers to salads to main course and also the desert and coffee and after dinner drink.  Wine selection was very good as was the cocktail selection.  Overall, we had a great evening and a memorable experience for our anniversary.  Tank you for treating us so well."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,3,2024-02-24,Great food and service! My favorite Italian place in town.
Foodie168,5,5,5,5,2024-02-24,Charcuterie and formaggi was delicious for both of us. Carpaccio is my new favorite; it has a rich tomato broth with lots of seafood. Very energizing. Husband had cannelloni and he enjoyed it too.
Patio,5,5,5,5,2024-02-23,Everything was amazing!! Including our wonderful waiter. All the staff was friendly and helpful! Our favorite restaurant!

VerityC,5,4,5,5,2024-02-18,Customer service was amazing. We went for our anniversary and were gifted and cute card and dessert. Our waiter also went above and beyond and rearranged our table to take pictures of us. Food was great but with a little more spice/seasoning it would have been even better!
YugiG,5,5,5,5,2024-02-17,"Value for money! It was my boyfriend’s birthday, our table had a little happy birthday card. The service was amazing."
gmhd,5,5,5,5,2024-02-17,Wow - Everything was divine.  Our server Matthew is the ultimate professional taking care of every dining need in short fashion.  He made restaurant dining a delightfully personal experience for us.  The food was delicious - the atmosphere relaxing - the evening - perfect!
KristinWP,5,5,5,5,2024-02-17,"Family night out to celebrate a grandfather’s birthday was so fun here! I have nothing other than rave reviews for the food, the wine list, the dessert menu, and even our server, Alex. I’m happy we had 5pm reservations to keep the noise at a minimum."
heidic,3,3,5,3,2024-02-16,"We love this restaurant however this time one of our dinners was sub par. The ravioli with boar. Tough and the sauce overpowered the pasta 

Don’t think the picked beans do anything for the grilled romaine. Tasteless Extra cherry tomatoes are more of a complement 

Good service as always. Extremely noisy"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-02-16,Kat our waitress was amazing!  Good and ambiance exceptional!
Ccrab,5,5,5,5,2024-02-16,"Excellent, classic Great Service, (which is super-rare nowdays).... All food exceeds expectations!  Rare to find a high-end lunch spot , great for happy hour or dinner as well...Thank you for being here."

GillianG,5,5,5,5,2024-01-30,We had a wonderful dinner here last night!!!   Pork chop was everyone’s favorite dish.  Cannoli Trio was special!!!
RazzleDazzle,4,5,5,5,2024-01-28,We  often frequent this restaurant & made our reservations months in advance to get a our favorite table for our birthday dinner. I called the day before to again secure our request and was told there was a private party & we could  not get our table or any table similar. I was upset & was told nothing could be done so I said due to anxiety we cannot do a table seated right near others along the window. That’s exactly where they put us. They completely ignored any of our seating requests. Food & waiter was excellent as always.
BigMeatNoWhammy,5,5,4,5,2024-01-27,Food always good. Service is pretty good.  Will be back at least 20 more times.
TomE,4,5,3,5,2024-01-26,The food was excellent. Many choices. Our waiter seemed to rush us. Also he never brought lemon for my water.
DEENAJ,5,5,5,5,2024-01-24,The sommelier gave some good wine suggestions. Everyone was quite nice and attentive. The food was fantastic. I will be going back again. ￼
OpenTable Diner,3,4,1,4,2024-01-24,took 21 minutes for a server to greet me and my guest
JohnH,5,5,5,4,2024-01-23,"Love having Carmines in Bellevue.  They have done a fantastic job of bringing the special experience of Il Terrazo to Bellevue.  

Went on a Monday night and it’s clear a lot of people agree.  A full house all night.  

Every course was excellent.  Well presented and delicious.   Recommended"

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-01-14,One of my favorite places to go. The minestrone soup is divine. I literally dream about this soup. Overall the food is delicious. I’m also obsessed with the bread. I had scallops with pasta Aglio e Olio. Absolutely delicious!
bjd811,5,4,5,5,2024-01-13,A little sad they changed the recipe of the bean soup but I STILL LOVE CARMINES!!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-01-12,Love Carmine’s- best service - food experience in Seattle/ Bellevue hands down!

Jerry,5,5,5,5,2024-01-10,"Food was excellent. The server was excellent. She was responsive, knowledgeable and friendly. It was friends birthday and she brought out a birthday dish at the completion of our meal. We’ve been to Carmines many times and have rarely, if ever, left disappointed. Last night was no exception."

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-01-07,"Never disappointed.
Great food and great service!"
OpenTable Diner,5,4,4,5,2024-01-07,"Visited Carmines for our anniversary, and it was a wonderful experience. The ambiance was lovely, offering ample seating and charming personalized table details—a thoughtful touch. Both the gnocchi and salmon penne were delightful, thoroughly enjoyed by both of us. Additionally, receiving a complimentary dessert for our celebration was a great highlight. The only downside was the challenging parking situation without validation. Despite that, I highly recommend Carmines for an overall fantastic dining experience."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2024-01-04,Awesome. Roberto the manager is THE BEST.  Service and food 100/10
RogerB,5,5,5,5,2024-01-03,"The food quality and selection at Carmine's is only outdone by their outstanding waitstaff who are very attentive, without being overbearing, and seem to sense when to interact with their guests.  Absolutely enjoyable evening, especially for special events / occasions.  We will definitely be dining more at Carmines in 2024."
Iwus,5,5,5,5,2024-01-01,"The entire experience was everything we could have asked for and more. Entire staff is very friendly and attentive, and the food is to die for."

BethN,5,5,5,5,2023-12-27,"Service was amazing, food was exceptional!!!"
KirkK,3,2,4,4,2023-12-23,"My wife and I came here for our wedding anniversary. We ordered the steak special and a lobster pappardelle pasta dish. The pasta dish had good texture and the lobster was tasty, but overall it was lacking enough sauce so it wasn't as tasty as it could have been. My steak was a disaster. I ordered it medium well but it looked like it was dropped into a fire pit and left there. It was charred all over! The edges were surrounded by burned fat - yuck. It also came in a surprising sweet sauce, which did not go well with steak. Overall, it was a very expensive but very mediocre entre. Our appetizers were fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The bread, on the other hand, was heavenly! It's the only thing that was great about Carmine's. Service was good but they did not even acknowledge our anniversary celebration, besides a ""Happy Anniversary"" card left on the table. Overall, it was a disappointing outing, especially the quality of the food and the value we got out of it. As much as I wanted to love this place, I can't say that I recommend it."
Tifa,5,5,5,5,2023-12-23,"Such a fun place to celebrate anything! Thanks for making it special! Shout out to Roberto ( front), Alfredo our server and Rodrigo at the bar."

EmilyT,5,5,5,5,2023-12-22,Such a festive atmosphere!  Great ambience and service as usual. Jovial but a little loud. Getting there took longer than expected with holiday traffic congestion. Lovely restaurant.
Krista,4,5,5,5,2023-12-22,We had lunch at Carmine's to celebrate the upcoming arrival of a friend's baby. The waiter we had was excellent and they even presented her with a Congratulations Tiramisu (which was the BEST tiramisu any of us have ever had). Thank you for making this such a special lunch for all of us.
DarciaT,5,4,5,5,2023-12-21,Always wonderful... Excellent foos and service. Especially love the ambiance and intimacy of the deck.
OpenTable Diner,3,5,4,2,2023-12-19,The noise level was entirely too loud for an easy conversation with not just our friends but also required repeating things to the waiter
TerresaP,5,5,5,5,2023-12-19,"Massimo was our server and he was on point.  He answered all our questions and verified that we wanted to enjoy our appetizers and wine prior to our meal arriving.  Carmine’s is a busy restaurant but we never felt rushed.  This was our first visit and we could tell that this is a Christmas tradition for many families. 
 I had the Penne Salmone and my husband had the Rigatoni Bolognese.  Both were amazing.  I highly recommend Carmine’s!  Make sure to make a reservation well in advance though."
NancyK,5,5,5,5,2023-12-19,Our third time to Carmine's and it was as good as we remembered!  We enjoyed every minute.  It was fun to look around and see diners celebrating Christmas there!

AlwaysAndForever,5,5,5,5,2023-12-13,Carmine's Bellevue is just that amazing place where you know you will be treated to the most fabulous food and the service will be equal to it. The specials of the night were beyond expectation and we tried several of them at our table of four. It's always special to dine at Carmine's and now I know we can request our favorite server -- Kat. Grazie!
HildaS,3,4,4,3,2023-12-13,Accommodation was poorly and misleading on the phone.
PatrickV,3,3,5,4,2023-12-12,No lunch without alcohol and for three people should come to $150 for Italian food. It’s just way too expensive for lunch.
jaminf,4,5,4,4,2023-12-09,Quality of the food was very good. The service is somewhat perfunctory.
JBKK,4,4,5,4,2023-12-08,"Our new favorite Italian restaurant in Bellevue area.  The food was delicious, but what really impressed us was the extraordinary level of service.  Even though the restaurant was full and the staff were hopping, we were attended to like we were the only table.  Definitely give Carmine's a try!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-12-07,The food and service were exceptional- the restaurant is beautiful. The best steak I have ever had. The scallops and lobster were truly amazing as was the bourbon bread pudding.
KathyS,5,5,5,5,2023-12-07,The Tuna salad is excellent. I love the quality of the tuna. Everything was fresh with a lite dressing.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-12-02,Great service and food. Their Alfredo sauce is great! A little loud
OpenTable Diner,2,2,2,4,2023-12-02,"Despite the challenges of securing reservations, my high expectations were met with disappointment. The service fell short, with a noticeable disparity in treatment based on our ethnicity, which marred the celebration of our special occasion. Despite these issues, we did find solace in enjoying most of the dishes. Overall, the experience was far from welcoming."
JannekeV,5,4,5,5,2023-12-02,"we loved our lunch and the waiters are the best. I did not give a 5 star, since I have celiac and a crouton (=gluten) ended up in my salad from a different dish."
PeterW,3,3,5,2,2023-12-01,We were sat next to a 10 top and the noise was atrocious.  Risotto was regular rice with a separated cheese sauce and my veal rib was over cooked.  Sever was great but the food has gone downhill.
Janine,5,5,5,5,2023-11-29,Came here for a birthday dinner we were treated great by all staff and our server was attentive and friendly. The ambience of the restaurant itself is exactly what we were looking for and the food was incredible.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-11-29,"Family favorite, Always good!!! Thoughtful for recent birthday celebration! Very nice and so kind ❤️"
AngelaA,5,5,5,5,2023-11-29,Wonderful service and several specials to choose from! Worth the drive for lunch. I look forward to going again.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2023-11-28,"One of the best meals I have had in years. Food and service impeccable. Gave a 4 for ambience because we were seated in the bar and while lovely, the big screen tv was a jarring counterpoint to otherwise beautiful surroundings."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2023-11-25,Great meal and outstanding service to celebrate my son’s 16th birthday. Thank you.  Consistently great on every visit.
OpenTable Diner,4,4,5,5,2023-11-23,We celebrated my husbands birthday. The meal was delicious. The service was top notch. There was a Birthday card at the table and a free dessert. Will definitely go back.
BellevueGuy,5,4,5,5,2023-11-23,Steak salad wasn't the best but everything else was fantastic!
TJinSeattle,5,5,5,4,2023-11-19,"Excellent menu., tasty food and excellent service. Pricey if you go all the way but not bad if don't. Kind of noisy when full on a Saturday night. Certainly will go back."
JudyF,5,4,5,5,2023-11-18,"We had a delightful lunch at Carmine’s in Bellevue, the service was impeccable without being intrusive.  It was very loud when we first arrived, but as the tables emptied the noise level was pleasant.  I had a pasta dish that was delicious and my friend had an entree salad that was good, but visually looked like a large amount of lettuce with a chicken breast laid over the top. It was much less appealing than my pasta, and somewhat hard to eat, since there was so much lettuce on the plate.  Carmine’s is a lovely restaurant with a warm interior and a cozy patio that would perfect if the weather is nice."
JulieH,5,5,5,5,2023-11-14,"Delicious lobster risotto and halibut special.  The caesar salar was also top notch.  Our server was attentive and knowledgable, helped me pick out a white wine to my tastes.  Appreciated the parking validation.  Prices are spendy but treat yourself, you deserve it."
Lovemesomegoodfood,5,5,5,5,2023-11-11,"We came to Carmine's to celebrate a birthday.  Everything was absolutely wonderful from the moment we walked into the restaurant.  The food was amazing, the service was tremendous and we will absolutely be back."
CateG,4,5,5,5,2023-11-11,First time visit. Enjoyed everything except the chlorinated table water.
Damay,5,5,5,5,2023-11-11,"Lovely setting across from the park in old Bellevue.  Professional staff, excellent service. Rigatoni bolognese was a nice touch over spaghetti. Ravioli with veal was excellent, in a rich veal Demi sauce. An added bonus is validated parking in the garage behind the restaurant."
G3inSea,5,5,5,5,2023-11-10,"Carmine's is an extraordinary restaurant, with exquisite food that's matched by its  outstanding service and ambiance. Highly, highly, highly recommend ... unless I need a reservation :)"
TylerR,5,5,5,4,2023-11-10,Waiter spilt a whole glass of water on me but somehow he turned it into a bonding experience and had a fantastically attentive experience to follow
JeanneB,5,5,5,5,2023-11-10,"Fabulous dinner with exquisite service !
The birthday celebration was a complete success."
JamesK,3,3,5,4,2023-11-07,"Birthday dinner was well recognized; the server was great; ambience was nice; there was free parking - but the food did not live up to expectations of a high-end restaurant.  Salad and wife's lobster risotto was good - in fact, risotto was very good.  Mushroom soup was pretty flat as was the veal ravioli - we expected more from this type of restaurant."
BrandonR,5,5,5,5,2023-11-05,"We went there for an anniversary and the food was great, service was excellent and seemed to know when we needed something without interrupting us too much. They also gave us a small dessert with happy anniversary written in chocolate frosting that was a very nice and memorable touch. 

The atmosphere is very nice without the prices of such an atmosphere. Great Italian food."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-11-03,Excellent as always! Service and food was fabulous.
Grandmere,5,5,5,5,2023-11-02,"Carmine's is a favorite for us.  Excellent food, impeccable service.  The only drawback is the noise level.  Last night the 4 of us had to almost shout to each other to be heard.  I will say, however, the place was crowded, so there you go.   Perhaps next time we'll request a table in the corner."
ChrisT,5,5,5,5,2023-11-02,Love it!  Always!  Never disappointed   Will always return.
KimB,3,3,4,4,2023-10-31,"They are famous for their gnocchi but ours was watery and not very good! We also had crab risotto which was so fishy we had to send it back. The salmon was amazing. Also, we all had Caesar salads and the dressing tasted more like watered down blue cheese  - there was no anchovy or traditional caesar flavor at all. Overall kind of a weird night taste wise for what is usually a stellar restaurant!"
ClaudiaA,5,5,5,5,2023-10-29,"Everything is amazing from the food, to the service and the drinks, my new favorite place"
Stacy,4,1,5,3,2023-10-28,"I have always enjoyed my meal but tonight my chicken piccata was beyond salty, extremely dry and very disappointing. Carmines is a nice dinner out for us and this was the first time I am now hesitant to come back for how expensive the meals are."
LisaR,5,5,5,5,2023-10-28,"Beautiful restaurant. Service was great. Fun atmosphere, can't wait to go back."
JonathanT,5,5,5,5,2023-10-26,"Great service, great food. Expensive and the noise level gets fairly high due to popularity/full dining room. I recommend if money and noise aren't deterrents to great food and service."
Brooklyne,4,5,4,4,2023-10-26,Overall experience was great. Only issue was one dessert came after the other 3 were already done eating.
gretaP,5,5,5,5,2023-10-26,Favorite restaurant hands down.  Eat here all the time and always above and beyond expectations.  Food is so good!!!
Mariah,4,5,5,5,2023-10-24,"Had a reservation for 2 for an anniversary dinner, and the service was wonderful and food was amazing!! The waitress, Ali, was super sweet and gave great suggestions for us. I asked for her suggestion between the gnocchi and rigatoni, and she recommended the rigatoni between the two. Ali suggested we split a large rigatoni into two smaller plates, with a small gnocchi too. As someone who doesn’t go to Italian restaurants often, nor do I know much about pasta, having those suggestions were so helpful! The rigatoni was delicious, and I highly recommend it for first-timers. The gnocchi was amazing as well, and it was really filling too. Even the small size would have me full on its own. We skipped appetizers, meats, and the pizza menu, but would love to try those next time. Since it was our anniversary, we received a complimentary dessert (tiramisu) at the end of the night and shared it between us two. The tiramisu was delicious, and even the chocolate sauce used for the writing was good too.

As for placing the reservation, I called to place a reservation at the patio, but didn’t receive a call back until about an hour or two later. I went ahead and reserved online instead, and once I got their call, we mentioned our online reservation and asked to be in the patio. The lady on the phone was very nice as well, and updated our reservation very quickly! 

Definitely will come back another time! Such wonderful service and food, and the ambience is wonderful. The heaters kept us warm throughout the entire dinner, and the patio is extremely pretty at night. Thank you to the team at Carmine’s for a memorable anniversary dinner!"
OpenTable Diner,3,3,4,3,2023-10-22,"Food was mediocre. I had fairly high expectations going in but the best thing we had was the Caesar salad. Definitely skip the risotto, it was super bland"
jason,5,5,5,4,2023-10-22,"We loved the portions, atmosphere, menu and the amazing service with Michael. We will be back!"
Ampetrin,5,5,5,5,2023-10-22,"Always excellent food,  perfectly friendly service,  and beautiful space!"
Ally,5,5,5,5,2023-10-17,"The best, as always! So delicious and the best service"
DisappointedinTucson,5,5,5,5,2023-10-17,Wonderful setting for lunch. Great ambiance with less unwanted noise than many other restaurants.
Bluewa,5,5,5,5,2023-10-16,"Heavenly experience.
I make it a point to go there often"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-10-14,"Absolutely fantastic experience, food was superb and the waitress was excellent and attentive. Highly recommend a visit."
MCLL,3,3,5,5,2023-10-13,"The foods was not impressed.  We ordered the new york steak, it was very thin and the waiter didn't ask how do we want it.  It turned out rough and dry.  The squid ink angel hair was nothing special, tomato sauce with seafoods.  The only highlight was the cream of mushroom soup.  The waiter was great, nice and clear."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,3,2023-10-13,"Incredible food, great service, very very loud! Couldn’t hear across the table."
MikeP,5,5,5,5,2023-10-13,One of my go to places ….another first class service experience
meghanc,5,5,5,5,2023-10-12,"Love the experience every time at Carmine’s! The ambiance is wonderful, the staff is attentive, and the food is fabulous. 10/10 would recommend."
YoungK,5,5,5,5,2023-10-11,Fantastic place for a birthday dinner! Highly recommended for a special occasion
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-10-10,"The food was absolutely amazing.  Our server was lovely and had excellent recommendations.
The gnocchi was the best I’ve ever had."
LeneeA,5,5,5,5,2023-10-10,Carmine's continues to be a favorite of mine.  I would highly recommend to anyone.
ctay,4,4,5,3,2023-10-08,It was prom night and it was packed. Table was too close to others. Food seemed rushed.
KevinK,5,5,5,4,2023-10-05,"Carmines is our place to celebrate special occasions!  The food is amazing, the service impeccable and we are always treated extremely well, whatever the occasion!"
Yamraj,4,4,4,3,2023-10-05,We were celebrating a Birthday event. The food was really good specially the Gnocchi. They surprised us with a birthday Tiramisu (which are also amazing).
ChrisH,5,5,5,4,2023-10-01,"Food was great, service was impeccable.
Was a little noisy"
Joey,2,1,3,3,2023-09-28,Food was below average for the price. The amount of seafood was much less than expected. The spaghetti was overcooked.
eatsoutoften,5,5,5,4,2023-09-28,Eat lunch at Carmines often and love being in Daniel's section.  Daniel is highly professional and friendly.  Lists the specials like a pro and is very attentive but not overly so.  Always enjoy our meals at Carmines and the people at the front are so helpful with the parking garage process.
Cilantrogal76,5,5,5,5,2023-09-27,"Great service, food, wine for a special Anny evening. I understand why reservations book fast."
JHSea,5,5,5,5,2023-09-24,Love it at Carmine’s so pretty and food is delicious!
ChrisT,5,5,5,5,2023-09-19,I love everything about Carmines.  I can't say enough good things.
ShawnS,5,5,5,5,2023-09-16,"The venue is small and the night we went it was very busy. It is not a quiet restaurant, but the energy is fantastic, the food is authentic and well prepared, and the service is outstanding. Everyone working there seemed to care about us and was proud of the restaurant. What a wonderful experience. The prices are very reasonable as well."
MelissaK,5,5,5,5,2023-09-16,"What a wonderful evening. Beautiful night in Bellevue. The food was incredible. And the staff so lovely to my dad for his birthday celebration. Big shout out to Julia the hostess and our waiter, Ryan. 
Thank you to all!"
Flyhigh,5,5,5,5,2023-09-15,Carmine's is always a pleasure.  The food is outstanding (had the black pasta with seafood at lunch yesterday) and the service excellent.  Both the Carmine's in Bellevue and the one in Seattle are 10 out of 10.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-09-13,Fantastic service and delicious food. Transported me to Italy.
Travelerswife,5,5,5,5,2023-09-13,Carmine's is my go-to place for all type of gatherings.  People are always pleasant and welcoming; the food is always great.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-09-13,"Wonderful lunch at Carmine’s this week with friends we haven’t seen since Covid began. Delicious halibut offering which we all opted for,  and enjoyed. The price point is high but service and food quality is well worth it."
Oldlady,5,5,5,5,2023-09-12,"Great food!  It lives up to its reputation.  The lobster risotto was a dream.

Special kudos to the valet service — prompt, accessible, and friendly.  This is especially important for us octogenarians."
ValerieC,5,5,5,5,2023-09-12,The eggplant parm was outstanding. Their tomato sauce is excellent. Flavors are wonderful.
Zainab,5,5,5,5,2023-09-09,"What a lovely experience. Not only the food was amazing but Service was out of this world! We came here for a celebration and Carmine's made sure that we were celebrated with a beautiful table setup, dessert, and patio seating. Thank you especially Natalie for coordinating and Micheal for serving us"
MarkW,5,4,5,5,2023-09-08,"Mista salad lettuce was soggy, steak was excellent"
Redmond1,5,5,5,5,2023-09-07,"Clearly this is a 5 star restaurant.  All the food items were excellent including the bread. Service was top notch. Cappuccino was extremely delicious.  Cocktail was very good and wine by the glass a little pricey but not unreasonable.  The only miss was on the frozen chocolate mouse dessert.  We would not order it again.

While we knew validated free parking was available, valet parking was a nice splurge.

Vibrant scene at the downtown Bellevue Park adds to the ambiance."
bjd811,5,4,5,5,2023-09-07,"I do wish that they had music playing throughout the restaurant. I know sometimes they do but today they did not and although my husband and I had a good time, the ambience felt boring."
CyndieM,5,5,5,4,2023-09-03,"We loved it here - first time but definitely not the last.  Great food, great staff, beautiful decor, huge wine and spirit options.  Their specials were amazing as well.  The only two drawbacks: no sommelier and it was really loud inside the dining room - REALLY loud.  Won’t stop
us from returning - but we will probably going earlier and during the week instead."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2023-09-02,Great evening! It was my birthday and we got complimentary deserts. Door excellent as always.
EricW,4,5,4,4,2023-08-31,Carmines is a great place to take clients. very classy environment
Rhonda,5,5,5,5,2023-08-30,We were celebrating our wedding anniversary & they were able to get us a table early since there was no room at the bar to sit & have a drink.  There was a nice 'Happy Anniversary' note on the table and our waiter was very knowledgable and friendly.  The food is always very good and of the highest quality.  This is our 'go to' for a nice dinner because the service is amazing and the food delicious.
VERSEA,5,5,5,5,2023-08-30,Always a wonderful experience.  Had the steak salad special for lunch and it was fantastic. I only wish I could have eaten their homemade bread but I am gluten free.  It smelled so good.  Umberto was our waiter and he timed our lunch perfectly.  Always at the top of my list when I visit Bellevue.
BruceK,5,5,5,5,2023-08-28,The BEST Italian on the Eastside!  Fresh and always delicious.
KylieB,5,5,5,5,2023-08-26,"My birthday dinner at Carmine's was amazing! Everyone made us feel welcomed, and multiple people wished me a happy birthday. The ambiance was perfect, the food was delicious, and our server Ali was amazing! Probably one of my favorite servers I've ever had. I also highly recommend the tiramisu. We were only visiting the area but if we lived there we would definitely be back to see Ali and to have more delicious Italian food!"
SteveD,5,5,5,5,2023-08-26,"We had a fabulous birthday celebration for our daughter. Carmines allowed us to add a 5th guest to our reservation at the last minute. Our server was excellent, and the food & drinks and desserts were awesome."
Burnie,3,5,5,4,2023-08-25,"We reserved ahead of time and specified that it was a special occassion when making the reservation. When we arrived, they had a table waiting for us. Unfortunately, it was smack dab in the middle of a very busy walkway with people knocking into it every time they passed. Knowing that it was a special occassion, I think Carmine's could have given us a better table, so that was annoying. Thankfully, when we complained, they did seat us at another table and the waitress completely made up for our bad first impression. She provided wonderful service, helped us select a great bottle of wine and made jokes with our teenagers. The food was delicious and we ended up having a really enjoyable dinner."
Nataliya,5,5,5,5,2023-08-25,"Wonderful place, tasty food , nice location . Really recommend this place"
KAYW,5,5,5,5,2023-08-25,"Great service. Daniel was exceptional.

Only con was no TP in women's bathroom…"
KarenaK,2,2,1,1,2023-08-24,"I wanted to take my girls out for a classy, authentic Italian dinner, and I thought this place would be great for that, but it wasn't. Although the decor is nice, it gives off the ambiance of a Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of how loud it is, and that was a big turn-off to me. We went on a Wednesday night, so I can’t even imagine what it's like on Friday or Saturday.  Our waiter was a jerk, to put it nicely, he was more concerned with the larger table, probably assuming the tip would be better, he barely checked on us and when I asked a question he spoke to me a condescending and disrespectful manner. It's expensive, and I expected that. However, you’re essentially forced to buy a bottle of wine if you want a glass because they charge $25-30 for 1 glass of wine, which is ridiculous. The bottles of wine are outrageously overpriced, and when I asked what the house wine was, the waiter sarcastically responded, ""There's no such thing."" I've been to more expensive restaurants than this one, and even they sell a reasonably priced house wine. The food was a step up from Olive Garden, nothing spectacular.  The manager did come over and make it right in the end, but honestly, the night was already ruined at that point. Definitely will never return to this restaurant."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-08-24,"First visit here, and we would highly recommend.
From the moment we walked in the door, the bar and our dinner table we were taken care of.
Wonderful experience and dinner was delicious!

We will definitely come back!"
marinas,5,5,5,5,2023-08-23,"We came to celebrate my husbands birthday on Tuesday night.  
The food was delicious. 
The waiter was very professional. 
The warm fresh bread kept coming as our 15 year old son was very hungry. 

Cons: 
Very very loud. 
Not a lot of room between tables 
Not enough servers/ waiters between the tables."
OpenTable Diner,4,4,5,4,2023-08-19,I would not recommend going for lunch unless you are walking.  It was stated on my reminder from Open Table that their is a valet for $5 OR parking in their building.  Neither was available.  The restaurant said that they no longer offer parking for lunch & according to my guest she said that the reason I could not get into the garage is probably because it was full.  Their was only one space when she got it & there could not have been more than 10 spaces available for the retail.
PamelaS,4,5,4,3,2023-08-18,"We had a wonderful meal at Carmine’s, but it was so noisy that our table of 4 had a hard time  talking to each other. An outdoor table might have been a better choice!"
OpenTable Diner,4,4,5,3,2023-08-18,Food was very good and service excellent.  It was really warm yesterday and the restaurant became quite toasty so took away a bit from the ambience and experience.
Glenn,3,4,4,3,2023-08-18,Long time patrons back to the 90's in Seattle.  We were looking forward to King salmon but found out you only offer farm raised salmon??!
SherriE,5,5,5,5,2023-08-18,"Fantastic food, great service! Will be going back!"
Haim,5,5,5,5,2023-08-17,"One of my favorite restaurants in the greater Seattle area, by far the numero Uno Italian restaurant.
It's impressive how this great team is able to sustain such great service, exceptional food, and an amazing ambiance for years.
It's a delight to come here again and again. It's unique to see the broad bandwidth. You can come for a quick casual dinner, a mid-day lunch or a formal business meal and the place will always make you feel welcomed. 
Thanks again
H. Kats"
DebyR,5,5,5,5,2023-08-17,Always a great experience and delicious food at Carmine's!
LoriS,5,5,5,5,2023-08-17,"I’ll definitely be back to test out more authentic dishes, we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and topped it off with amazing cannolis. I’d recommend!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-08-16,Business dinner at Carmine’s. Food was excellent and service to match.
BrianC,5,5,5,5,2023-08-15,Carmine's never disappoints. Always a great experience.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-08-12,Had a wonderful birthday experience at a beautiful setting and delicious food.
OpenTable Diner,4,5,2,2,2023-08-10,*UPDATE*. I was contacted by management and they were super apologetic and appreciative of the feedback. We were there tonight (8/28/23) to celebrate my moms 80th with our family and the service could not have been better. Everything was perfect and vey true to Carmine’s.  We booked a table for our daughters bday next month and can’t wait. Thank Carmines for continuing to be our favorite spot in Bellevue. AMBIANCE AND SERVICE 5 STAR!!Carmines is our go to but this visit wasn’t great. We had friends in town and were excited to bring them but we were hugely disappointed with the service this time. We were at a table over by the bathrooms and it was like they forgot about us. We weren’t even sure who our waiter was.  Embarrassing after we talked up how great Carmine’s is. We have a reservation in a few days for a birthday celebration and I’m hoping it’s not as disappointing as this visit was.
BradG,5,5,5,5,2023-08-10,Hard to find a restaurant that excels at everything but Carmines definitely does it.
Robja,4,3,5,5,2023-08-08,"Most of the food was very good. Halibut was disappointing. It did not seem fresh. Not flaky or tasty.
Kat was great waiter. Outdoor seating is very pleasant."
Iwus,3,5,2,5,2023-08-06,Love food and the ambience at Carmine’s but service was not great this time. Disappointing as we had family visiting us and the experience just didn’t live up to our expectations.
Gr8ful,4,4,5,5,2023-08-06,"Amazing experience at this beautiful, professional, welcoming and all around happy establishment.  From their parking with 4 hr validation, enjoying the most flavorful and well cooked pasta entrees to the end of saying ""thank you and see you again"" it was a gem of a place to celebrate our 28th wedding anniversary.  Make your reservation early to confirm your amazing experience!"
Carrie,5,5,5,4,2023-08-05,Excellent service despite being so busy on a Friday evening. Delicious food. Will come back again. Thank you!
LaurenS,5,5,5,5,2023-08-04,Kat was the best server we have ever had! The experience was amazing. I enjoyed all the food as always but her service really made our night after a rough day. I will ask for her every time!
MarcyF,5,5,5,5,2023-08-04,"It is always an event to dine at Carmine’s.  The staff is efficient, professional and most importantly seems happy to be there.  Bravo to the management!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-08-02,The best restaurant on the east side!  Food service and ambiance all top class. We love coming here! Thank you for everything!
JaymeK,5,5,5,5,2023-08-01,"Amazing food, service & ambience.  Can’t wait to go back!"
BenyU,4,4,2,5,2023-07-30,"I’ve been to this restaurant many times but last night July 29 I was a bit disappointed with the service received
I got there for dinner with friends, and the waiter did not come by our table to refill our glasses or ask us for anything else not even once
A bit disappointed"
BrianM,5,5,5,5,2023-07-30,We went here for our anniversary and felt like it was a special day with the dessert and kind note. Loved the seating and layout of the restaurant. My wife said it feels like we were in Tuscany.
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,5,2023-07-29,We had a great birthday dinner. Ambience and food is great. I will definitely recommend it to my friends!
MCLinWoodinville,5,5,5,5,2023-07-29,"Took my sister for her birthday during lunch and the service was attentive, professional but not pretentious. Whether a daytime lunch or evening out, Carmine’s does not disappoint."
Kris,5,5,5,4,2023-07-29,"I am a frequent customer. I enjoy lunch here with antipasto, sometimes a chef pizza, chioppino, and an espresso following the meal. Other of my favorites are the veal scallopini, osso bucco, and pastas. Table linens, fabric napkins, plate service, nice glasses for drinks, clean bathrooms, all help make it feel like an excellent value. It is also a great location next to the Bellevue Park for a walk after the meal."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-28,"We live in the neighborhood, and bring along our older Labrador, Bleu, to enjoy the patio with us.  He just loves to watch the movement and enjoy his special water he receives from the staff.  The food, service, wine list, cocktails are alway excellent and on point.  The specials are always exceptional, and we haven’t ordered from the menu yet.  Just love to enjoy this eatery and recharge from whatever the week has brought.  Highly recommend!"
Foodie168,5,5,5,5,2023-07-27,As someone with gluten intolerance I appreciate being able to enjoy their fantastic risotto. Of course they also can make their pasta dishes with GF pasta and I tried that before and it was great. We had lunch at Bellevue Carmine’s on a sunny day and the ambiance was wonderful.
ElizabethH,5,5,5,5,2023-07-27,Carmine's is our favorite restaurant in Bellevue!  Great food and service. Delightful.
Briac,5,4,5,5,2023-07-23,"I took my sister here for her birthday. She loved it and it was very cute with great service. I have had better Italian food before, but it sure is up there and the service is over the top."
JohnD,5,5,5,5,2023-07-23,"This is our go-to restaurant in Bellevue. We never have been disappointed. The food, service, and ambiance are top shelf. As I am hard of hearing, it can get a bit loud."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-23,Amazing food and service. The gnocchi melts in your mouth.
LaurenE,5,5,5,5,2023-07-22,It was incredible. The food and the service were great.  It was just an overall wonderful experience.!
miki,5,5,5,5,2023-07-22,Another great Carmine’s experience! Will continue to come back.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-21,Very accommodating staff.  Beautiful environment with great food.
JWo888,5,5,5,5,2023-07-20,"Carmine’s is one of my favorite restaurants in Bellevue, because of the delicious food and excellent service.  I met a friend who I had not seen in over 20 years here for lunch.  We enjoyed the nice weather by dining in the patio area and enjoyed the Portofino Salad, Insalata di Mista and Cioppino. Food and service was exceptional !"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-20,This place is hard to book because it’s so good and too many people know it!  But it’s worth the effort to plan ahead. Great food. A must visit when in the Bellevue area.
Parker,5,5,5,5,2023-07-19,"No one in my party had dined here prior including myself. What a great find this was. Our service was fantastic, food delicious and so many fresh specials they nearly needed their own menu. We will be returning as a group as well as many of us individually."
OpenTable Diner,5,3,5,5,2023-07-19,Always good my 87 Y/O Mother’s favorite lunch spot. Service was great but food wasn’t as yummy as usual. Freshness lacking
Itwasgood,5,5,5,5,2023-07-18,We had a great meal and great service.  I would highly recommend this spot
OpenTable Diner,2,2,3,2,2023-07-16,This restaurant was on my list for long but hard to find last minute reservations as it’s always busy. But honestly it’s overhyped and overpriced. Service is great and some of the dishes are wonderful but some are not even seasoned well. Portions could be better for the price paid! Have had better Italian food and would not go back here for this price. Btw their sister restaurant in Seattle is definitely better!
PNWwifey,5,5,5,5,2023-07-16,It was our first experience at Carmine’s for my husband and I.  The food was amazing.
michaelm,5,5,5,3,2023-07-15,"GREAT food !!!
very nice service..... but busy  (a  bit too busy )

great place to eat , a bit loud and very ""booked""  / busy
makes the service a little slow , but still VERY friendly and professional"
Goldy,5,4,5,5,2023-07-15,"They did a really great job with this new restaurant! It feels like a special place to be. The indoor/outdoor flow is really nice. It is very open and airy inside. The service here is very good. Lots of attention to detail. The food is solid. I wouldn't say it's outstanding, but for the volume that they are doing, it is really good. I've eaten good things here before, but this time I didn't like what I ordered at all. A filet mignon salad. It was the special and it had both blue cheese and radicchio in it, making it super bitter and almost inedible. My daughter and mother-in-law liked their halibut and cannelloni very much. Overall, really nice restaurant to celebrate or just have a nice meal."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-13,"Wonderful food, wine, and cocktails. We were there to celebrate our anniversary and the Carmine’s team did not disappoint - excellent ambience, a little happy anniversary card, and tiramisu on the house which was some of the best I’ve ever had. Would 1000% recommend. Definitely going back."
BobbiC,5,5,5,5,2023-07-12,"Alberto was our waiter. He was delightful.
The restaurant is always accommodating.
Always great specials besides the menu items.
Lunch crowd was a bit loud which made it slightly hard to hear my guest across the table.
But I love the decor and ambiance of the restaurant."
AkshayM,5,5,5,5,2023-07-12,"Great food , our server (Massimo) was very helpful and took care of our needs very well. We had a pizza with sausage and gorgonzola cheese and a fettuccine with pesto and shrimp and it was divine , the portions were very good for the cost . Loved it ! Would recommend!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-12,"The best day in / day out fine dining restaurant in Bellevue.

A credit to the history of Carmines"
LisaO,5,5,5,5,2023-07-11,"Exceptionally delicious meal.  Perfect cocktails.  Excellent wine.  Wonderful service.  Perfect place for a special occasion, romantic dinner, or to gather with friends."
MidoriS,5,5,5,5,2023-07-11,Always a great dinner with great service!  Our go to place for any occasion!
Flosser,5,5,5,5,2023-07-11,"Carmine's does not disappoint.  Whether you are there for a special occasion or dinner with friends, your dinner is exceptional."
OpenTable Diner,1,1,2,1,2023-07-11,"My recent anniversary celebration at Carmine’s was a disappointing experience.
First and foremost, despite making an reservation and mentioning our anniversary, we were assigned a table that was located right next to the corner of a busy street during the rush hour. The noise from passing cars, pedestrians, and the smell of gas made it impossible to enjoy my meal. When I requested a different table, the host said all tables are reserved and this table has more privacy. Seriously???? There were plenty of empty tables throughout our entire dinner, which made the seating situation even more frustrating.
The quality of the food was underwhelming. It appeared as though I was served leftovers rather than freshly prepared dishes. The bread was hard and dry. A lot of online reviews had praised complimentary anniversary or birthday dessert, but we left without any such dessert. Honestly, based on my experience, I can’t recommend this overrated & overpriced restaurant to anyone."
JenniferE,5,5,5,5,2023-07-08,"Loved the food, atmosphere and service.  Great experience!  Thank you!"
JayLeeC,5,5,5,5,2023-07-07,"Always a delightful experience. The service, food, and atmosphere are top-notch. We ordered the Harrelson steak and crab cakes and I'm dreaming of the next time I can go back and order again! The new bread pudding is not to be missed, we licked the plate clean. Such a special place to eat for any occasion."
LauraB,5,5,4,4,2023-07-07,Pricy but AMAZING!! We really enjoyed this place & highly recommend for special occasions.
Nino,5,5,5,5,2023-07-07,Wonderful place to spend time with friends and family❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-07-06,"Celebrated our Anniversary. Glad we came here, best experience we’ve had."
ShellyL,5,5,5,5,2023-06-29,Excellent service and fantastic food.  Service in the bar area always above and beyond.
Yotedigo,5,5,5,5,2023-06-28,The service and food was excellent. The level of noise inside was high and I asked to move our party outside. One more remark: my Italian friend found 6/7 spelling mistakes in the menu. At this level of restaurant we expect a error free menu! Absolutely recommended!
GoodDiningPdx,4,5,5,4,2023-06-28,Gear staff and food. Loud environment for meaningful conversation
PhillipL,5,5,3,5,2023-06-24,"Love the ambience! ￼
Out of town guests thought the food was amazing!!  Favorite Italian place in seattle!"
MichaelH,5,5,5,5,2023-06-24,"We had antipasto assortito and crabcakes for appetizers, both were delicate yet tasty and wonderful. My wife had gamberoni proviciale (sauteed prawns) as her main dish and I had the Australian ""Tomahawk"" Wagyu steak. The prawns were excellent and the steak was a unique experience of texture and taste, the beef version of premium ""toro tuna"". I appreciate the staff and chef's talent to deliver this experience.

Service by Paulo was exceptional. He knew the menu, made excellent suggestions including a nicely paired wine, and arranged the timing and plating of dishes perfectly. Other staff were also attentive but not intrusive, keeping my ice water glass full and the meal appropriately flowing.

This was truly a special dinner and very close to a ""perfect dining experience"". Thank you, Carmine's!"
EricP,5,5,5,5,2023-06-22,fabulous dinner - but you pay for it!  Very strongly recommended
foodluver,5,4,5,5,2023-06-15,"We celebrated our anniversary at Carmine's this year! The service was wonderful, all the staff were so diligent. The food was amazing and dessert was even better!"
JulieR,5,5,5,5,2023-06-15,"food is great service is terrific and friendly also] you eat at the bar but a reservation
helps a lot"
RahulG,5,5,4,5,2023-06-14,Fantastic place for work lunches and family dinners!
Critic,2,2,4,2,2023-06-14,"At a place like this, I feel like they should be able to cook your salmon the way you ask them to. I asked for medium rare, toward rare, and got well done. My pasta was stuck together. I do a better job at home. We waited at least 45 minutes for our food. Maybe don't overcook it and then it can come out sooner?
The restaurant was so loud that I had to shout to be heard by the person next to me. 
The server was friendly and helpful."
JohnH,3,5,5,2,2023-06-14,"Service was fantastic, food was good, but way too loud for conversation. Giant echo chamber and you have to shout to be heard across the table. Appropriate for a bar maybe, but not a restaurant. They need to add some noise absorbing panels to reduce the noise to a manageable level."
SandyG,5,5,5,5,2023-06-14,"What a wonderful spot for dinner, whether sitting inside or outside!
Our waiter was very friendly and gave us good recommendations for dinner and picked out a great bottle of wine."
BradG,5,5,5,5,2023-06-13,Went to Carmines to celebrate our 41st Wedding Anniversary and we loved it!
Dawg,4,4,4,4,2023-06-10,A family go to for us.  Never disappointed.  Thankful for Carmines.
ChristyH,5,5,5,5,2023-06-09,Wonderful experience for us. Will definitely come back!
MarthaK,5,5,5,5,2023-06-09,"My friend and I always come to Carmine's for lunch.  We were both celebrating our birthdays.  We received a wonderful birthday dessert, after a fantastic lunch!  PLEASE keep the steak risotto on the menu - it just melts in your mouth!  Our server was wonderful too.  Thank you for a wonderful day at Carmine's."
DG123,5,5,5,5,2023-06-04,"Carmine's reliably provides a combination of outstanding food, service and ambiance. We had a terrific meal."
MichaelS,5,5,5,5,2023-06-04,"We ate at Carmine’s last Saturday and had a great experience. 
The ambiance felt upscale, inviting and comfortable. Our waiter, Paulo M, did a wonderful job of ensuring a  positive experience. He is very professional with high-level guest service skills. We started by sharing a traditional antipasto with their delicious Italian bread. My main course was Cioppino which was loaded with a variety of seafood, a fresh tasting tomato based broth and crostini. My partner had the Scalloppine de Vitello and was very happy with his selection. We plan to save room for dessert next time and would love to see more non-American wines offered by the glass."
DaleS,5,5,5,5,2023-06-03,"A birthday celebration , Carmine’s never disappoints!  

Especially delicious this time was the copper River salmon and lobster risotto. 

Service is attentive while still being respectful. 

A gem of a place for special celebrations."
Friends,5,5,5,5,2023-06-01,"Best authentic Italian Restaurant, great atmosphere, superb service. Always an amazing experience overall!
AH"
KennethT,4,4,5,4,2023-06-01,"Our overall experience at Carmine's in Bellevue was very good.  It's one of the best restaurants in Bellevue and that's why we continue to return.  When we're in the mood for a good meal, outstanding service and a terrific venue we book a reservation at Carmine's."
JimD,5,5,5,5,2023-05-27,"Our waiter was fabulous the food was excellent, thoroughly enjoyed our meal &  would highly recommend. The wine list is quite extensive too!"
Kirklandresident,4,4,3,3,2023-05-25,"A lovely restaurant with lovely food.
Wasn't made to feel overly welcome on arrival however our waiter was fantastic and made up for the negative arrival experience.
Good food and wine list.
Would probably not go back as price did not match service or ambiance."
DoriR,5,5,5,5,2023-05-24,Incredible meal with amazing service!  A night to remember!
KimberlyS,5,5,5,5,2023-05-23,"We had an incredible dining experience at Carmine's. The service, the food, the aesthetics were all superb. We would definitely go back the next time we are in town."
BrianL,5,5,5,4,2023-05-20,"Outstanding food quality. Exquisite taste from appetizers to main entrees. Much attention to detail on presentation. Our favorite restaurant on the Eastside. It will be your go to restaurant too after you dine there. Also, unique cocktails. Five stars *****!"
LisaP,5,5,5,5,2023-05-19,"Carmine's exceeded our expectations, again! Our office is always excited when they find out we're going there. All food was excellent, service knowledgeable and expert but unobtrusive, and the beautiful decor is clear evidence that they are at the top of their game. Already can't wait for our next visit!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-05-19,I’ve been to Carmine’s many times over the last two years and it never disappoints from food to service. It’s a must in Seattle.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-05-19,Great service.   Amazing food.  Yet another wonderful visit.
Heather,5,5,5,5,2023-05-18,"We sat on the patio last night and enjoyed early summer weather - the food and drinks were excellent, and the wait staff were so pleasant!  Excellent experience!"
GoodDiningPdx,5,5,5,4,2023-05-17,Great cocktails and chicken dish. Great server and greeters.
Andrew,5,5,5,5,2023-05-15,Long time customer of Carmine’s. Great service and food as usual. Always a great place to eat.
Stoyanov,5,5,5,5,2023-05-12,"Great place to have business lunch. The restaurant has consistent food quality, wonderful staff and services as well as good ambience. I have been a regular customer shortly after its opening. Love this place."
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,1,2023-05-11,Everything was wonderful but man some sound dampening could sure help. It was aggressively loud
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-05-10,Parking is some what complicated but food is amazing and great service :)
VickiB,5,5,5,5,2023-05-06,Everyting was great - The food was excelent - Thank you
Maggie,5,5,5,5,2023-05-05,The mushroom steak risotto was fabulous..such a gem locally
WilliamS,4,5,5,5,2023-05-04,Great food and service.  Our indoor table location was too noisy for good conversation.  Wish we had been able to be outside. Will be back on a sunny day.
Matt,5,4,5,5,2023-05-02,"Food & drinks were good. The waiter was awesome, would definitely go back just for the kind of service they provide."
SeattleTraveler,5,5,5,5,2023-04-30,Fun. Inviting. Expensive. Hang out for Bellevue's money's crowd and hangers on.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-04-29,"Always fine in food, service and ambiance. Now in the good weather the patio is open."
CPete,5,5,5,5,2023-04-28,"Great dining and service!

Their parking is confusing and complicated."
Beth,5,4,5,4,2023-04-28,"I had a lovely lunch on a beautiful day with a friend.  Great food, attentive service, lovely setting- all was great."
CoralB,5,5,5,5,2023-04-27,"My Italian coworker recommended this place. I went with my husband for his birthday, and he said it was possibly the best risotto (his favorite) he's ever had. They also wrote him a Happy Birthday card and brought out a complimentary cake with candle! I also went while pregnant, and their non-alcoholic cocktails were great."
LAPB,3,3,5,5,2023-04-27,"Halibut was the fish special and lacked flavor. One in our party is strict vegan and she was served plain tasting pasta with tomatoes and pine nuts.  Lacked any flavor.  Strawberry cheesecake was a bust, no real cheesecake flavor.  Old fashioned and Faust Cab were excellent.  Service was good."
OpenTable Diner,4,3,5,3,2023-04-26,"It was good! Overall good. Nothing fantastic, and nothing awful."
Stella,5,5,5,5,2023-04-25,"Carmine's is a special restaurant in ""Old Bellevue"".  Pricey, but worth it!  Wonderful food and great service."
Yths,3,2,3,3,2023-04-23,Food is okay. Avoid the steaks like the plague and get the pizza.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-04-23,We have been here once before several months ago and “Kat” our server remembered my wife and I more importantly that we relocated from Chicago. Very impressive on professional server staff.
Seattlebip,3,3,2,4,2023-04-23,"Food was mixed bag for us.  The pasta dishes we ordered were tasty. The osso bucco was decent but not stellar and the duck was dry and tasteless. 

Service was strange. The support staff were great and our waters were regularly filled.  But our waiter acted oddly. He was affable but he never told us the specials, asked us if we wanted drinks or dessert or starters. It was my husband’s birthday so they brought us a tiramisu but never asked us if we wanted dessert. Our waiter spent more time with the table next to us and he seemed to give them full service vs giving us limited service. Maybe he was trying to get rid of us early? 

Overall a mediocre experience. This is my third time at the restaurant and second so-so food experience and my first bad service experience. A mediocre rating is a fail for an upscale dining experience."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-04-21,We love Carmines and save it for special events such as birthdays and anniversary’s. Carmines never disappoints.
LuvItalian,5,5,5,3,2023-04-21,Awesome dinner and service. Enjoyed our evening completely!
Ramiyer,5,5,5,5,2023-04-18,Awesome food and experience a bit noisy .. given glass windows
MikeR,5,5,5,4,2023-04-15,"Terrific food, service and location. Parking can be a challenge as is hearing your companion over the rather loud background. Prices are reasonable given the location, so I rate the value good. My only issue is I think $35 for corkage is too much. $25 is more appropriate in my view."
suziedewitt,5,5,5,5,2023-04-15,Paulo was our waiter and he was AWESOME!! We (3ladies) were a little loud celebrating the fact that my husband called ahead and paid for dinner. Paola and the other WADE stuff were really great. We had a wonderful evening. The wine was excellent. Food was excellent.!
Boppy,5,5,5,5,2023-04-15,Our experience was phenomenal!  Our table was beautiful and the presentation was impressive.  Had a wonderful night!

TedA,5,5,5,4,2023-04-15,"Amazing food, great service. A little loud but that just meant folks were enjoying the evening. We had a great night."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2023-04-14,Always excellent in every way. The noise level in the restaurant is sometimes difficult . We prefer the bar.
steven,5,5,5,5,2023-04-12,"Have enjoyed the Seattle location for many years but for this
visit we tried Bellevue. The server was terrific. All good."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-04-11,Lovely service! Attended for my brothers birthday. They seated us 30 mins earlier than our reservation which was really nice. Service was attentive and timely. Great place for a quiet dinner with great food.
AliceC,5,5,5,5,2023-04-11,This was our second time for dinner and both were excellent meals and service and beautiful atmosphere.  This is now our go to restaurant for all occasions. Thank you Carmine’s!

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-04-08,Always good. Have dined at both locations and never had a bad meal
OpenTable Diner,4,4,3,4,2023-04-08,"We felt rushed by the staff person who took our orders.
Some customers were very loud, laughing like no one else was present."
Winne2,5,5,5,4,2023-04-07,"I am not a local, but Carmine's has become my go-to dinner spot to meet with customers, business partners, and friends on the Eastside.  The calamari fritti were excellent, including the dipping sauces, and the fresh garden salads with a balsamic vinaigrette were a great palate cleanser before the main course.  

This week's halibut special, dredged in crushed pistachios, was exceptional - the preparation was outstanding and the combination of flavors excellent.  Thursday seemed to be date night - as well as martini night - so the scene for a couple of business people was entertaining!"
AnjuliM,5,5,5,5,2023-04-07,"My husband and I came in for dinner last night and had such a great time! We had the burrata appetizer with arugula with fig balsamic and cherry tomatoes to start, it was so fresh and delicious. We split the Filetto con gnocchi and the risotto with crab, mushrooms and truffle oil (so decadent), but the real star of the meal for us was the steak—it melted in our mouths. Loved the gnocchi and veggies it came with too. Our server, Cat, recommended amazing wine to compliment the food, was so thoughtful about our time constraints with the coursing and knowledgeable about the menu. We felt so pampered on a rare night out without kids, we can’t wait to come back!"
SanFran,5,5,5,5,2023-04-07,Lovely spot for date night. Fresh Italian food & fantastic service.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-04-06,"My girlfriend and I came in for my birthday last night. We were blown away by the charming impeccable service and the delicious food. The ambience was amazing, great energy all around. Everyone around us also seemed to be enjoying themselves. We toasted with an amazing gin based cocktail called A Night in Milano. We had the fillet with gnocchi, pistachio crusted halibut, and the spaghetti with fennel sausage. The finale was red velvet cake (we really appreciated the complementary tiramisu dessert with happy birthday written in chocolate too)! I felt special and spoiled, it was a beautiful birthday to remember. Thank you to everyone at Carmine’s!"
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2023-04-06,The staff is awesome and the food is remarkable.  The risotto and salmon was to die for.
Jill,5,5,5,5,2023-04-05,Food is consistently delicious at Carmine's! I had the special- mac & cheese with dungeness crab. This entree must be put on the regular menu...it's so good! The bread here is also so yummy and fresh every time. We love Carmine's.
JamesW,4,5,3,4,2023-04-05,"Overall dinner experience was quite good.
Hard to carry on a conversation with the noise level in the dining room.
Completely parking a REAL PLUS."
BobW,5,5,5,5,2023-04-05,"Always love going to Carmine's...whether it be Bellevue or Seattle.  Food, service and ambience are always topnotch.  Keep up the great work!"
AnnS,5,5,5,5,2023-04-05,"Wonderful as always. I love Carmine’s Bellevue! The outdoor dining area is beautiful, with heat for cold days. The food is excellent. I highly recommend it!"
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,4,2023-04-01,"We come here all the time. Carmines is our favorite restaurant in Bellevue!

My experience is as a little off this time around but the owner Philip called me and immediately made things right. Speaks volume of their character and why the restaurant restaurant is ran so well.

I highly recommend dining here. You will not regret it."
Keddy,4,4,5,4,2023-04-01,"Overall experience was great. Best thing was the food. I’ve been
to a lot of restaurants and i must say this the best steak I’ve had! I had it well done and it was not dry. Full of flavor and just melt in your mouth. My girlfriend and i went for just a Friday night date night and we spent little over $200 for the two of us including tip. Great experience amazing staff will come back for sure!"
GerryZ,5,5,5,5,2023-04-01,Much enjoyed the restaurant. Service was excellent

We had to raise our voices to be heard across a small table."
Travelerswife,5,5,5,5,2023-03-29,Carmines never disappoints with their overall excellence.
JeffK,5,5,5,5,2023-03-26,Amazing - best Italian in the whole area.  Service and environment is perfect for special occasions
JasonE,5,5,4,3,2023-03-25,"Great food, although the acoustics in the restaurant made it too noisy to have a conversation even at our own table of four people"
SandyR,5,5,5,5,2023-03-24,Great place for special lunch.  Arrive early for best seating.  Parking takes time to find.
Tony,3,3,3,3,2023-03-24,"We had very good memories of the original Carmines in Pioneer Square so we tried dinner at their Bellevue location. 
We asked for two glasses of wine and were amazed that we were charged $30 per glass. No comment from the waiter as to pricing. The rest of the meal was of reasonable quality but again overpriced. $200 for two people. 
Many other good restaurants in Bellevue for use to attend."
JayLeeC,5,5,5,5,2023-03-24,"Dinner was delicious, as always. The staff goes above and beyond to make your dining experience wanting you to come back again and again."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-03-21,My son took me here for a birthday lunch. Everything was wonderful. 10/10 would recommend 😀
KatieM,5,5,5,5,2023-03-19,It was our first visit to Carmines. Walking in the patio was absolutely stunning and the inside as well with all of the details. The service was wonderful and very helpful. We ordered two of the specials and those were good but next time I am definitely ordering a big bowl of pasta! The taste I got from the pasta was to die for!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-03-18,Incredible experience at Carmine’s. We had Matthew as our server and he was a complete delight. Very attentive and charming. Food was better than what I’ve had in Italy. We will be back!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-03-18,Loved everything about the place from food to service to ambiance!!  Thank you!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-03-18,Same high level of competence as usual.  Everything is good !
MelKirkland,5,5,5,5,2023-03-17,Hands down my favorite restaurant in Bellevue! Their food is always amazing and the service is top notch!
TonyM,4,5,5,5,2023-03-17,Everything was great but a $35 fee for corkage is too much!

JohnU,5,5,5,5,2023-03-16,Great food and a wonderful server.  Definitely coming back!

TanyaR,5,5,5,5,2023-03-11,Such an amazing place with incredible food and service
TeeVibe,5,5,5,5,2023-03-11,"This was my first visit to Carmine's, but it won't be my last.  We were immediately seated, had amazing service and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  I was even more impressed by the flavor of the food and that my food was actually hot when it came to the table.  You would be surprised how often that doesn't happen.  It was expensive, but worth a very special occasion or celebration."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-03-11,"Always professional service, excellent food  and wine. Everything goes well."
JanetG,5,5,5,5,2023-03-11,1st time I’ve tried Carmine’s and have already recommended it to others :-)
SkipB,5,5,5,4,2023-03-10,"Wonderful menu and wine list.  Lovely restaurant.  Excellent service.  Food is beautifully presented and absolutely delicious (NY steak and Lobster risotto entrees, tiramisu and mousse desserts).  The noise level was very high because of large, loud groups on a Thursday night so I can't recommend it for a romantic dinner (conversation is difficult) but we really enjoyed dining here and will return!"
Jenn,5,5,5,4,2023-03-10,Variety of delicious dishes.  Service was impeccable.
Tuckerboy,5,5,5,5,2023-03-10,"Great place for a weekday lunch. Comfortable,
Great service, fresh delicious food. One of the few ‘old school’ style dining experience left .Superb!!!"
TraceyH,4,5,5,3,2023-03-09,The food and service provided by Michael were excellent.  It was so loud in the restaurant I could barely hear the people at my table which detracted from enjoying the evening.
TeresaH,5,5,4,5,2023-03-09,"Great food, adequate service
Needed waters refilled, etc."
JohnT,5,5,5,5,2023-03-09,Always amazing and they always deliver! Miriam was our server and she's the best. One of my favorite restaurants.
JoshMitchell,5,5,5,5,2023-03-08,Wow! What a dinner. We were celebrating my dad's birthday and they went above and beyond for us! They had a very kind birthday note written for him at the table when we sat down. The wait staff were all very friendly and the dinner was amazing! Every item we had blew away our expectations. The Gorgonzola crusted NY strip was the favorite. We will be back again!
Karen,5,5,5,5,2023-03-08,"Always an elegant experience, lovely setting, charming waitstaff."
Matty,5,5,5,5,2023-03-07,"Great as always.  Delicious food, good wine selection, wonderful service, and tasty desserts."
MaryG,4,4,5,4,2023-03-03,"Service was fantastic from all waitstaff.  Food was very good except for halibut which was overcooked.  They took it off bill, which was nice but disappointing a bit in terms of experience."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-03-02,"The food, the service, the ambiance - always amazing. Highly recommend. Dinner at their Bellevue or Seattle location, never disappoints!"
CindyR,5,5,5,5,2023-03-02,"Consistently fabulous. The food, quality specials, the service, EVERYTHING about Carmines is delicious. Our group of four especially enjoy the bar seating as it is so much quieter for conversation. Thank you! Grazie!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2023-03-01,"We had a great time.

However I find all the dining chairs to be very uncomfortable.  The padding is worn out in the seat which makes the seating too low. Time to replace them."
ShaunaB,5,5,5,5,2023-03-01,"Carmines was perfect. The menu was outstanding and the food tasted so good. We had wine, appetizers, main dish and dessert.  Everything we had exceeded my expectations!"
GailL,5,4,5,4,2023-02-26,Lovely dinner! Love Carmine’s decor. Food was delicious. Service was excellent. Wish it was easier to get reservations and to get into the parking garage!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-25,Great food and service. Jarrod was an exceptionally good server!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-24,Had a fun time celebrating my daughters birthday!
DawnG,5,5,5,5,2023-02-24,Such a great experience - food and service were both expectational.
Zach,5,5,5,5,2023-02-22,"Great spot to take a date and have a night out. The environment was great, location was awesome right downtown, and parking is easy!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-21,"We never fail to love Carmine’s.  We requested and received our preferred booth seating inside, and the service was, as always, spot on.  We never feel rushed and are always accommodated and feel welcome.  The bar drink (Gunsmoke Manhattan) was great, the wines by the glass to follow excellent with our meals.  The sautéed spinach is a tour de force every time, the warm bread and butter a guilty pleasure.  We split “cups” of the minestrone soup which is portioned like a bowl and tastes like it was delivered from a fresh vegetable garden.  The venison ravioli with spinach and mushrooms was outstanding.  The flavors of everything down to the lemon meringue dessert are fresh, and intense.  Lovely late lunch again.  Compliments to the house, the staff, the chef.  Thank you."
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,5,2023-02-17,Our server Daniel was amazing. Made our first visit to Carmine’s such a wonderful experience. Will return again.
Jesk,5,5,5,5,2023-02-16,Fabulous food! Quality service/staff! Great location

Tifa,5,5,4,5,2023-02-15,Carmines a favorite now for our family and we love the food and the ambiance! It’s our goto for all occasions.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-11,My friends and I came into Carmines for to celebrate a birthday. We had a great time and thank the staff for an amazing meal and attentive service. We will be back!
DianaB,4,5,5,2,2023-02-11,"We love the excellent food, attentive service, and elegant presentation, but find the noise to be too much…as well as the difficulty in finding parking.  We’ve had several celebratory dinners and lunches at Carmine’s, but may not return simply because we can’t converse over the clamor.  Maybe some sound management such as carpeting or a matt flooring would help.  Otherwsie very good!  Thank you.

Would recommend to a friend, but with a caveat about the noise."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-10,My boyfriend and I had a perfect meal at Carmines. The food was so delicious and the service was fun yet professional. We loved the rigatoni bolognese and the veal with capers. We can’t wait to visit Carmine’s again soon!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-10,"My wife and  I had an amazing evening at Carmines. The food came out hot and  perfectly prepared. We started with prawns in tomato sauce, then moved on to the grilled romaine salad. For the main course the rack of lamb and the nightly steak special served  oscar style…all incredible. The steak was the best steak I have had in a long time. We finished our evening with espresso martinis and the dessert special of the night, strawberry cheesecake. The service was perfectly paced and we left feeling spoiled and beyond satisfied. Thank you Carmines for a wonderful evening. We will be back!!"
SPWS,5,5,5,5,2023-02-10,"Great Italian food, chic ambiance and excellent service. Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."
anne,5,5,5,4,2023-02-10,"Celebrating an early Valentine’s Day.  Great wines by the glass, pasta with sausage and fennel was delicious as was the potato encrusted halibut.  Wonderful menu!"

It's a great place for a celebration or just a random Wednesday night out."

RobertoG,5,5,5,5,2023-02-08,"My sister and I have a wonderful time at Carmine’s Bellevue!

We really enjoy the burrata!
The homemade pastas are so delicious!  Fettuccine Al Pesto, Rigatoni Bolognese 😘

The cedar plank salmon must have!"
ArnieB,3,4,2,3,2023-02-07,Food was good. Service not so good last night. Despite a reservation made 2 weeks in advance we were seated at a poor table. Very cramped for two and in a major walkway. Service was slow and inattentive.
Nikolay2,5,5,5,5,2023-02-07,Everything is good although parking is chore with Q codes dealings
Minnie,3,3,3,4,2023-02-05,"Table wasn’t ready when we were sat. Hostess had to finish setting table, while we were sitting. Waited a long time for server to come to our table. Steak was overdone. Asked for medium. Received medium well. Have had much better dinners and service at this price point."
DennisC,5,5,5,5,2023-02-05,"Pretty loud, but always great!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-02-01,Amazing experience!

Tbik,5,5,5,5,2023-01-31,Great birthday lunch for a dear and deserving friend!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-01-29,"If you are looking for an all around elevated experience Carmine’s is the place. The cocktail and wine menu is exciting. Go for Beef Tartare, the spaghetti with homemade pasta and fennel sausage and the Ossobucco. Great nightly specials too! Every dessert (spumoni and red velvet cake) is amazing too! The welcoming staff makes you feel at home while the fancy vibe reminds you that you are somewhere special. Thank you Carmines for your consistency and supreme unmatched hospitality. 👏🏻👏🏻"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-01-29,"The best restaurant in the city by far- potentially the state. Ossobucco is always divine and the chefs specials are always thoughtful and wonderful!

Service could not be better, unobtrusive but attentive.

WOW!"
oliver,5,5,5,5,2023-01-29,Where do I begin? Service: outstanding. Food: impeccable. Ambience: immaculate. Deserves Michelin recognition.
CarlW,5,5,5,5,2023-01-28,"Carmines was an excellent place to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Prompt service, delicious drinks, excellent service and the ambiance that made her birthday everything she wanted. We will be back for more celebrations in the future."
kaym,5,5,5,5,2023-01-27,First time at the Bellevue location for a friends birthday. Fabulous! Did not disappoint! Parking was tough…
luckylindy98072,5,5,5,5,2023-01-25,Everything was amazing except for our little table next to the stairs. I expected much more in that I made the reservation days in advance on Open Table and they stated that I’m a VIP…which apparently doesn’t mean much :)
ShellyL,5,5,5,5,2023-01-25,"Outstanding food, and service in the bar by Alberto and the team were amazing, as usual."
Christoph,5,4,5,5,2023-01-25,"Excellent service, and excellent menu.  Will return."
ac209,5,5,5,5,2023-01-24,The best Italian and maybe the best restaurant in Bellevue.  Unpretentious.  These people love what they do.
go4sid,3,3,2,3,2023-01-21,Food and wine were great. Good ambience although it was a bit too crowded for me.
MarieV,5,5,5,5,2023-01-21,We love the atmosphere and the service.  We’re never disappointed in the food!  It’s always outstanding!!
JohnM,5,5,5,5,2023-01-21,Excellent food and service was over the top. Little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for applies.  Great place to eat.
msbobh,5,4,5,4,2023-01-19,"Service and staff were excellent, as was the special lobster risotto. A salmon pasta dish was underwhelming due to the salmon.  Otherwise the preparation was fine, lots of garlic and olive oil."
LQKNEE,5,5,5,5,2023-01-19,Always wonderful!!
GreatDinner,5,5,5,5,2023-01-14,Alberto provides awesome service! Food is superb.

JULIEL,5,5,5,5,2023-01-13,"Wonderful food, great ambiance, feels like you are in Italy."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2023-01-13,"Everything about Carmine’s is always so elegant, professional, friendly.  The food was delicious (squid ink cappellini) and the service was attentive.  I love the white tablecloths, the servers in their white jackets.  The atmosphere is like being in a starred restaurant in Italy.  Very special.  Carmine’s and Il Terrazzo have been my go-to dining for special events for YEARS."
YolandaS,4,3,4,3,2023-01-11,The foods were unusually salty that day we sent back 1 dish but ate the rest didn’t want to cause problem
JillR,5,5,5,5,2023-01-10,Great service. Great selection of food. Wonderful experience for lunch on a Monday in Bellevue.
Gippy,5,5,4,5,2023-01-08,Food was amazing.  We sat for about 15 minutes prior to seeing a server.  Very apologetic about the oversight.
RobynL,5,5,5,5,2023-01-08,Our waiter was outstanding and so attentive!  Amazing food as always!
OpenTable Diner,4,4,3,5,2023-01-07,"Overall good, service is a bit slow."

Woodinvilledad,5,5,5,4,2023-01-04,Great food and great service. Tends to be noisy. But food is so worth it
GregC,5,5,5,5,2023-01-04,We love dining in the bar. Alberto and team are always fantastic.
Daisy,5,5,5,5,2023-01-03,Very good service.  onetime reservation seating.  Food served hot and in a timely manner.
Rosie,5,5,5,5,2023-01-03,"The Rack of Lamb was beyond description. Outstanding is an understatement. Same for the Roasted Duck. Our server, Jocelyn D,  is the true definition of a professional - so gracious, cheerful, responsive and an ingredient that added so much to a perfect evening."
Belltowndiners,5,5,5,5,2023-01-01,Our first opportunity to dine at this location.  Now a new favorite!  The staff from hosts to servers and kitchen was as good as it gets.  Our server Paolo was exceptional.  He knew the menu inside out and had great recommendations.  And the menu selection has every possible Italian favorite including often hard-to-find Oso Bucco.  We can’t wait to return.
Four,5,5,5,5,2022-12-31,Always delicious food and excellent service!  Our favourite Italian restaurant
CareFriends,5,5,5,5,2022-12-31,"Always a lovely experience at Carmines. Good food, good services, lovely environment. Valet parking also a plus."
LynneL,5,5,5,5,2022-12-30,"Took out-of-town family in for Christmas for a lovely dinner after a show at the Paramount.  Our time at Carmine’s was the perfect finish to our day. From cocktails, wine, appetizers, main dish and dessert…all were plated and displayed beautifully and delicious.  I’ve been here three times and the service is top notch. I highly recommend.  The valet parking is reasonable and very convenient."
SLG2015,5,5,5,5,2022-12-30,Carmines accommodated every request with good cheer. We enjoyed an excellent night with excellent service.
MACEats,4,5,5,4,2022-12-30,"Solid choice for Italian on the Eastside.  Perhaps the best.  White tablecloths gives this formal vibe but it wasn't pretentious.  I had the risotto which was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I went for lunch with friends, and it was a bit loud for my taste but not ridiculous.  Service was excellent despite being a bit rushed as they were closing the kitchen for dinner service.  Overall, I would recommend."
ThomasKellerwannaBe,5,5,5,3,2022-12-30,"Carmine's is always a good choice.  Food, service, wine are all excellent.  Its a bit noisy and crowded with the Bellevue girls (real estate agents) that lunch or a birthday party of 15 ""Karens"" giggling at the top of their lungs. But they are entertaining."
OpenTable Diner,4,4,4,4,2022-12-28,For my friend’s birthday
RichardA,1,1,4,5,2022-12-23,"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire Seattle area. However today my food was late … someone forgot to cook it and then I got apps, salad and soup all at the same time. My Mac and Crab n Cheese was not close to the usual standards of this restaurant. I will come back as it is my favorite but I was very very disappointed this time."
TSTUD,4,5,4,4,2022-12-20,Pasta was excellent. Cauliflower soup was delicious. A little noisy and chilly but would absolutely return and recoo.
OpenTable Diner,4,5,4,5,2022-12-17,"Everything was wonderful except we waited a long time for appetizers, then starters came, and mention that entrees were next.  Asked about the appetizers which were apparently forgotten.  Apologies offered and we moved on, but it did detract from a perfect dining experience."
gmhd,5,5,5,5,2022-12-17,Lovely food in a very Italian setting.  Very popular at Christmas lunch time.  And the dessert menu is wonderful.
NancyT,5,5,5,5,2022-12-17,Service and food are outstanding!  The ricotta and gnocchi are absolutely ethereal; truly the best I have ever had!
CPete,5,5,5,5,2022-12-17,Great Christmas lunch with close friends
Lucy,5,5,5,4,2022-12-14,Great food and wonderful service. It's a little loud and it would be nice to have an area that is a little more intimate and quiet.
Mizu,3,2,2,3,2022-12-13,"The atmosphere was fantastic - however, the food was overly salty, not good. I was overcharged with double corkage fee of $70. $35 per person. I only brought 1 bottle. I never experienced a restaurant charges a corkage fee per person instead of per bottle. Not acceptable when I was excited to try this restaurant based on great reviews and also my good friend recommended me. A bit disappointed, however, after I addressed to my server, she took off the one of the double charged corkage fee. I wouldn’t go back there again. Sorry."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-12-11,perfect spot to celebrate our anniversary ❤️
Parker,5,5,5,5,2022-12-10,"Great for friends, a date,  business engagement, and a special occasion. Carmine’s always gets it! Fabulous food, ambience and service! The best of Bellevue and Seattle. A classic!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-12-08,First time visitor but will be returning. Every part of the experience was fantastic and I appreciated the staff helping with a holiday gifting event.
KellyM,5,5,5,5,2022-12-08,"As always, It was a wonderful meal! Our server, Daniel, was wonderful: attentive without being obtrusive and extremely helpful. The manager helped me select what turned out to be a wonderful wine (and very reasonably priced too!). I had the venison ravioli, which is one of my favorite dishes at Carmine’s and my guest was very happy with the halibut. Thank you for the complimentary birthday dessert as well! All in all, a great lunch and we will be back."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-12-07,The food was fabulous! We had a lovely time celebrating our 3 year anniversary!
AndyR,5,5,5,5,2022-12-07,"We had a great dinner and a wonderful time at Carmine's. The room was inviting and alive, the dinner was fantastic, and John, our server, was professional and helpful in describing the various selections. We enjoyed our visit to Carmine's and will be back."
Teddy,5,5,5,5,2022-12-07,Christmas lunch
KreaMus,3,3,4,3,2022-12-04,"Noise levels are insane. We booked a table and were seated next to the private party booth. That has no noise insulation at all. There was some wild party  going on, with very high sound levels. And we were seating right next to it. Awful noise insulation in this location. 
Ordered veil with capers that I used to love in the past, and it was oversalted. Same goes for my husband 75$ rib eye steak. Oversalted. 

The cauliflower gratin was great, as always. Sweet canoli were great. Overall, the final bill amount felt to me too high, considering the oversalted main dishes and the wild ambience, with noise levels that won't shame a night club with a free bar."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-12-04,Simply wonderful. Our server was supreme. Food fabulous.
Zoom,4,4,4,4,2022-12-04,Everyone in our party enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere.
BDFoodie,5,5,5,5,2022-12-03,"Wonderful food!  Always hot and delicious!  Our service was phenomenal.  Fast, attentive and cared."

EricA,5,5,5,5,2022-12-02,My favorite in the settle Bellevue area
DaneP,5,5,5,5,2022-11-30,"Amazing place.the waitress was extremely attentive to us and the food was absolutely amazing. It was slightly expensive, but for a special occasion it is worth it."
Steve,5,5,5,4,2022-11-29,"Carmine's is ALWAYS great...great service, great wine list, great food. It is conveniently located in Old Bellevue. We go there often"
Jojo,3,3,3,5,2022-11-22,"Although the quality of the food is evident the flavor is lacking for our taste. If you're looking for savory you won't find it here, but if you're looking for creamy,quality and light you will. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, 4 pasta dishes (SM) and 3 desserts totaling $204. Will I be coming back? Most likely not and it isn't because of the pricing which isn't terrible when you consider the quality, it's because of the flavor. Would I recommend this place? Yes because the ambience is absolutely stunning and although the food lacks the wow factor you'd hope for at those prices, it was still satisfying! Great place for a date night with someone you're serious about."
OpenTable Diner,4,4,4,4,2022-11-22,"Overall it was good experience and good food.
We didn’t like a server much."
JenniB,5,5,5,5,2022-11-19,"Great ambience, exceptional service, and everyone loved their food. We will be back."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-11-18,"Shared the evening with out of town guests.  Wonderful time, meal, service and an evening they will never forget!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2022-11-18,Everything was great except the noise level. It is hard to hear each other.
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2022-11-17,"The food and service is always outstanding!  It is my ""go to"" restaurant."
SarahD,5,5,5,5,2022-11-15,Amazing fried calamari and pesto! Would recommend to anyone wanting authentic Italian.
Aoxxxxccccc,3,4,1,4,2022-11-15,"Low level of service. You always have to wait for a table. If the table is booked, the waiters are waiting for a large order from the client and are not in a hurry with the service. If you order only one dish without alcohol waitresses discuss it."
love2bicycle,5,5,5,5,2022-11-13,"Depends on what you order. I love some of their dishes, not others. Veal, fish cioppino, those are great. They do vegetables wonderfully, I'd come here for just that. We have never tried any of the steaks. My husband loves the way Carmines does pasta. Other than that, there is the beauty of the restaurant, the dishes are superbly crafted, the dishes and furnishings are old world, and very charming. We happen to love it."
EmilyAnna,5,5,5,5,2022-11-12,"That Ossobuco is the most phenomenal dish on their menu! We’ve never had a bad meal or time. Thanks for always keeping it top notch, Carmine’s!!"
OpenTable Diner,4,3,4,5,2022-11-12,A bit disappointed with the food
MIHS,5,5,5,5,2022-11-12,I love everything about this restaurant.
loulou,5,4,5,5,2022-11-12,Very nice place and good food
Scotts03012024,3,4,3,3,2022-11-09,"Dinner was delicious along with the dessert. The big disappointment was the service that overshadowed what could have been an epic birthday celebration.  It appears that Carmine's needs more wait staff, we had to ask a server for our waiter every time we had a request; not good."
JED56,5,5,5,5,2022-11-08,"What a great place! It makes the Seattle location proud.

OpenTable Diner,4,3,5,5,2022-10-29,Service was excellent but the food was too salty for our liking.
tomw,4,4,4,4,2022-10-28,The only negative was that the cushion on my chair was wet with water and wet the back of my pants. My wife's birthday dinner was great!
LynneL,5,5,5,5,2022-10-28,My second time here and the food and service are wonderful. Never feeling rushed. Knowledgeable wait staff. Great food.
Gigiingram,3,4,5,3,2022-10-28,"Our table was right by the dish washer, we smelled bleach throughout lunch.  It was also a very noisy table.  I was disappointed because we had a hard time conversing.  
Our waiter was great, food was good."
Wally,5,5,5,5,2022-10-26,Nice lunch before going to the airport
Isun,4,3,4,4,2022-10-26,Very nice location and interior. Nice service. A bit noisy. We ordered bongore and Seafood pasta with squid ink angel hair. Food was ok but not great. No flavor of squid ink. Portions were too small.

Everything was absolutely perfect"
JodiD,5,5,5,5,2022-10-23,Carmine’s exceeded our expectations. Roberto our server was attentive and very know about the menu. The menu had a variety of options and all of the entrees ordered were outstanding.

NancyB,5,5,5,5,2022-10-13,"Carmine's Bellevue is our favorite ""go to"" restaurant for a special occasion anniversary, birthday or ""just friends catch up"" lunch or dinner. The food, service and ambiance are always excellent."

Zeesal,5,5,5,5,2022-10-09,"Greeted warmly. Seated immediately. Our waiter, Michael was amazing! Great suggestions and prompt attention throughout meal. Appetizer of charcuterie was nice to share. Wine selection is impressive. Osso bucco was falling off bone and flavorful with large tasty marrow bone. Filet served with gnocchi was cooked to perfection, also with an amazing reduction. Profiterole dessert and cappuccinos ended a perfect meal. We had a lovely night at Carmine’s and can easily see why reservations are somewhat difficult to schedule. We will be back again!! ❤️"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2022-10-09,My wife’s birthday. Just outstanding!

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-10-06,Simply the finest dining experience you will have in the pacific northwest
OpenTable Diner,4,4,5,5,2022-10-05,The large portion of cannelloni could have been bigger
OpenTable Diner,1,5,1,5,2022-10-04,"We had to flag down our waiter militiple times during our dinner. Both my boyfriend and I have worked in high demanding customer service jobs before so we understand how things can get. However, we had to wait 15 minutes after we finished our drinks to even order a second round and our bread never came as well. We love dining here and have always been super happy with our experience but this time around we were left feeling very dissapointed."
OpenTable Diner,2,1,3,3,2022-10-04,"Disappointing. Poor quality of cooking.

The Calamari fritti was very oily, mushy and not crunchy at all because the cook didn’t fry them right. My husband and I felt sick right after eating the calamari. (We don’t have allergies to seafood. We are both calamari fritti lovers.)

Poor presentation on dishes. They didn’t put any herbs on my fish. Here is NOT another cheap eatery.

Pasta with bolognese sauce. They didn’t bring cheese and a grater, so WE ASKED them to grate cheese on it.

We felt like there was the absence of any chefs for our table. I don’t think it’s good value for the price."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-30,We had a chance to celebrate our Anniversary here and everything was perfect! Thank you for a good memories!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-30,The best of it all.

rsa1,5,5,5,5,2022-09-28,Fantastic food and service. Definitely the place to go for a special meal. Only comment is can be noisy - we were in a smaller alcove which made it better but still hard to hear conversation (and I have no hearing issues).
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-24,"Great food. The entire dinner was fantastic. Make your reservation in advance. It is worth the wait. 

Thx

mikeg,5,5,5,5,2022-09-15,A perfect evening✨
SeattleFoodSearch,2,3,4,2,2022-09-14,"Honestly, for having made a reservation in advanced for our anniversary, I was disappointed to be sat in the middle of a ton of commotion, and honestly while the food was decent, for the price I had higher expectations. I wouldn’t recommend this place, which is unfortunate because it seems as though it could be a promising atmosphere."
Allan,4,5,4,3,2022-09-14,The main problem with this restaurant is that it is simply not a place to go to have a nice relaxing meal.  The tables are packed together but the main problem is the extraordinarily high noise level.  We were a table of 4 and most of the time could not hear what each other was saying.  The waiter could barely hear the order.  People at other tables were all similarly yelling to be heard.  The restaurant has many hard surfaces and could easily improve the sound situation by adding some sound absorbing materials as many other restaurants do.  The food is quite good and the service professional but there are many other more relaxing options for Italian food.
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2022-09-13,"Excellent food, atmosphere, and staff.  Britney was great!"
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,4,2022-09-11,"Very enjoyable experience, The food taste, quality and quantity were excellent accompanied with outstanding service.  Tables comfortably spaced giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy both their meals and company. Fully occupied for a Saturday evening dinner creating a moderate but comfortable noise level. Food menu prices reasonably on the high side. Extensive wine menu but with unreasonably high prices compared to comparable restaurants in the area."
downtowngirl,5,5,5,5,2022-09-11,It was fabulous!!!!!

jane,5,5,5,5,2022-09-11,Service was very attentive.  Veal scallopini and veal chop were well prepared.  The Caesar dressing was tasty. Valet parking appreciated.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-10,"A wonderful evening.  A lovely setting.  Carmines is nestled within a lovely tree lined neighborhood adjacent to Bellevue Park.  Our server Bethany was excellent, very personable and attentive.  The food was excellent.  Specifically, the Gnocchi, Rigatoni Bolognese, and Squid Ink Capellini were delicious.  Tiramisu and Red Velvet Cake finished the evening nicely.  Will happily return."
JoyS,5,5,5,5,2022-09-10,A great place to take someone who you are trying to treat. Loved their spumoni ice-cream and bread.
Vince,5,5,5,5,2022-09-08,"I was there with a friend for my birthday. The food was nice and the service was superb, definitely recommend!"
DonH,4,4,5,5,2022-09-08,Very good food with the exception of a limpid Caesar salad. This is a pricey restaurant which is OK but the entree food portions are very small.
MeredithS,5,5,5,4,2022-09-08,"We had a wonderful time at Carmines for my birthday.  Excellent service, delicious food, the best Lemon Drop ever.  Definitely a return visit is in the cards."

angie,5,5,5,5,2022-09-07,"Great attention to details!  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted in a respectful and friendly manner.  We got an awesome table near the patio door so the wind was able to blow through during the warm evening.  The wine list was extensive and somewhat intimidating if you didn't know your Italian wines.  Our server, Sossity, was very helpful in choosing a wine based on our preferences, but not an overly pricey choice.  All the food was amazing!  We were visiting from out of town, but we will be back in the future!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-04,Jesse was our waiter and did a terrific job!  The food was perfect as always. We can't wait to go back!

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-02,"Food was spectacular and our server was prompt despite how busy it was.  We come to Carmine’s every chance we get.  Wanted Seabass and the server double checked for us, but honestly that was a-ok because we tried a king salmon pasta dish that was spectacular!  Thank you Carmine’s!  Don’t ever change!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-09-02,"Roberto was wonderful! Alway love our experience at. Carmine’s, always made to feel special, thank you!"

Tara,5,5,5,5,2022-08-24,We had a fabulous meal last night.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  The sever was super nice and very attentive.  The food was delicious.
Maggie,5,5,5,5,2022-08-20,a most wonderful chicken salad and Jesse was terrific. four of us celebrate each of our birthdays here
CrisM,4,5,4,5,2022-08-19,Wine was tasty food was really good and the service was nice. The only reason they didn’t get a five star is because the server forgot about us and we had only had bread and water for the first 30 minutes. We had a late reservation and the restaurant was cleaning up for the night so it’s not a big deal. I would have rated 4.5 stars if possible.
AnnS,5,5,5,5,2022-08-19,"The food is wonderful and the service impeccable. I especially like to eat al fresco. It's so pretty outside! One comment: way too much salad dressing! Next time, I'll order the dressing on the side."
eatsoutoften,5,4,5,4,2022-08-19,"Had lunch at Carmine's, eat there at least once a month.  Excellent service and very good food."
PJSPT,5,5,5,5,2022-08-18,Excellent service and delicious food. The waiter was very professional & knowledgeable- add to that a delightful personality and it was a rewarding  dining experience. The dining room is lovely and parking was easy in the garage at the back of the building.

AriahO,5,5,5,3,2022-08-12,"Beautiful restaurant, incredible service, amazing food. Wish it was a little quieter but we did sit near the kitchen."
RobertC,4,4,5,5,2022-08-11,"For starters we ordered the Burrata with vegetables, it was okay. 
The Calamari Fritti was delish, would definitely recommend that as a starter. 
For mains we ordered the meat special of the day, Porter House. The steak was good, the mushroom vinaigrette sauce a little too sweet for me. We also ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese which is very delightful."
DonnaS,4,4,4,4,2022-08-11,We always enjoy Carmine's.  My only complaint over the years is that the cushions on the dining chairs are two soft.  They seem to be sinking with age and need to be replaced!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-08-10,"Food was excellent, generous portions, attentive and engaging wait staff. Looking forward to our next visit!"
ScottO,5,5,5,5,2022-08-10,"Food and service were impeccable. Our waiter, Massimo, was attentive without being intrusive, and provided great service. The ambience was great, too. Highly recommend the Carmine's dining experience."

Gr8ful,5,5,5,5,2022-08-06,This was a great place for any occasion.  The food was yummy delicious and just a little different than your typical Italian restaurant...you will see what I mean when you go there.  Our server was friendly and had good suggestions for our dinner.

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-08-04,Great. Good and service
ElizabethM,4,3,5,5,2022-08-03,"I ordered the halibut special BUT it was supposed to have asparagus & carrots - one one inch asparagus too, no carrots, sauce was delicious. Kind of expected at least some accompaniment"
Morleys,5,5,5,5,2022-08-02,"Really enjoyed ambience, waiter and food. Great overall experience for first date !"
savydiner,2,1,3,4,2022-08-02,Ambiance was good and the service was okay but the food was not good.  Way overpriced and tasteless.  I would not go back there and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Beebman,5,5,5,5,2022-07-31,"Carmine's is our favorite restaurant.  Great food, wonderful staff and pleasant ambiance.  Will be back again."

VincentB,4,5,4,5,2022-07-26,"The website offered valet parking for lunch and dinner. We were there for lunch, and expected it. The receptionist said only for dinner. I suggested that the website was wrong. I suggested that it be corrected; but, it did not seem too important to her!"
Steve,5,5,4,5,2022-07-25,"Carmine's is ALWAYS good...good food, great service, full wine list. We have been there many times and always enjoy. This time, however, through no fault of the wait staff, the kitchen got backed up and it took longer than normal to serve us. The waiter did keep us apprised of the situation."
EmilyAnna,5,5,5,5,2022-07-24,"Such a beautiful venue and experience. Have always had the best time, great wine and exceptional service. Can’t wait for our next visit! 

Thank you for making our anniversary so special!"
GreggR,4,5,3,4,2022-07-24,"Great visit Saturday evening.  Food was really good and the service was prompt and friendly.  I took off one star for service as I feel we were misled on both an entree order and a glass of wine.  For the entree issue, my friend could not decide between 2 dishes so the waiter said he would give her half of each.  She was charged for 2 small portions instead, which came out around $7 more than getting just a large.  We did not complain as she did get 2 smalls and paid for 2 smalls, but that was not the assumption.  The wine issue… a friend wanted a good Italian wine and the waiter said he would get her something good.  So he picked the highest priced glass of barolo.  I think if she knew the price she would not have ordered that, but he did not give her any choice.  Again, she got what she paid for, so no issue with that, it’s just kind of an underhanded upsell.  Still would highly recommend the restaurant, just be clear what you want to order and what you’ll pay.  Several visits here and this was the first issue we had, so you should be fine."
Brian,5,5,5,5,2022-07-24,One of the best Italian restaurants I’ve been to!!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-07-23,Great calamari and service.
miki,5,5,5,5,2022-07-23,"Amazing food and service.  carmine’s does not disappoint!  My go to for a long leisurely lunch with my bestie.  We had calamari which was delicious and tender. Lovely ceasar salad, perfectly dressed. And lovely fresh pasta….to die for. So tender and delicious.  Perfectly sauced and portions were generous but not too massive. We will be back! Ps sit outside, it’s lovely."

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-07-22,Food was outstanding!!!
TonyGirl,5,5,5,5,2022-07-20,"Carmine's is a must do experience. Never disappointed in all the years we have been going. Both Seattle and Bellevue.
The only difference between the 2 is the noise level in Bellevue is way too high. Seattle seems more calm. However, I will still go to Bellevue. It's a winner."
CaymanPirate,5,5,5,5,2022-07-20,"Fantastic service and food.  Expensive, but the presentations and tastes were amazing.  VERY loud, however, which brings the experience down a notch.  All in all, a great place to go and repeat going!"
KevinK,5,5,5,5,2022-07-20,Celebrated an anniversary at Carmines. We had a personalized note waiting at the table and a complimentary desert with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the platter.  Paulo our waiter was outstanding and the food was amazing.  As I finished my well proportioned meal and was sad it was coming to an end!  We will be back!
RomanP,5,5,5,5,2022-07-15,Everything was truly amazing. My girlfriend and I had an amazing time and will definitely be coming back in the near future.

SeaGal22,5,4,5,5,2022-07-07,"Great location and evening for outdoor dining on a pretty summer evening with good friends. Our server was top notch, anticipating our needs and very attentive given the busy dinner hour. Made reservations well in advance. Enjoyed a great bruschetta to share for 4 of us with plenty to go around—the salmon was the best on this trio. No complaints from us on our salads and entrees—halibut special was piccata style and beautifully presented. Coolked to perfection. Loved the bread pudding for the grand finale. Hope to be back soon."
OpenTable Diner,3,4,2,4,2022-07-06,We were really looking forward to celebrating my husband’s birthday here. We have been here a few times and really enjoyed it and the service was always on point but unfortunately this time was a let down. In the past they have had a cute happy birthday card but maybe that’s not a thing anymore. Server was nice but was missing most of the time and didn’t come over often. Our plates were being cleared in a rush before we were done with our appetizer. We didn’t even bother staying for dessert this time. Overall the food was good but the experience for the price wasn’t worth it.
NancyS,5,5,5,5,2022-06-29,"Beautiful setting outside with outstanding meal.  Our table had appetizers, hot and cold entrees and all were served at the right temperature with no shortcuts for lunch selections.  Always dependable - one of my favorite go-to's!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-06-29,Best food and service.  Thank you
Dggg,5,5,5,5,2022-06-28,"Again my wife and I greatly enjoyed each item we ordered. We will continue to visit for special occasions. FWIW I had the king salmon (cooked perfectly, medium) and asparagus risotto (also perfect, al dente and not too much cheese, not goopy). She really enjoyed the pan-seared halibut."
KatieY,5,5,5,5,2022-06-28,We went to Carmines for our anniversary and it was great. Food was delicious and staff very friendly. They also gave us a free dessert that said happy anniversary. Would def go again.
KenT,5,5,5,5,2022-06-25,First time for us and will not be the last.  Every aspect of the evening was superb.  Absolutely nothing to criticize.  Five stars in all categories!
HawkHead,5,5,5,5,2022-06-25,"We were able to get patio seating early Friday evening.  Our waiter Alex was the best, our food was awesome - both fresh, wild seafood dishes.  Bread and salad were great...the Tiramisu was mediocre.  Don't go here if you're starving.  Portions are small."
JohnH,5,5,5,5,2022-06-25,"Awesome selection on the menu, the eggplant appetizer is perfect and lamb is to die for. Great wine selection and fantastic service."
davidd,5,5,5,5,2022-06-23,"This restaurant is one of our ""musts"".  Great food, very nice atmosphere and great service.  A quality place to dine!!!!!!"
AqeelH,4,5,4,4,2022-06-22,"wonderful food, great service and small portion size meant food wasnt wasted."
Negotiableterms,5,5,5,5,2022-06-21,Magnificent!
KenE,5,5,4,4,2022-06-21,"The food was wonderful, from the bread and appetizers through main courses. Tartar was delicious, soup was foamy and fresh, risotto perfectly cooked, and the Scaloppine di Vitello had a well balanced flavor. 
Service was quick and courteous, the decor was simple and beautiful, quiet enough for talking yet lively just enough. We would definitely visit again!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,3,5,2022-06-20,"Carmine’s is a favorite. Reliable food. Generally good service. We keep getting stuck with one server who is kinda a tough nut to crack though. Not so free with his smiles and disappears frequently. Otherwise, it's a beautiful place to celebrate special and just average occasions."
David,5,5,5,4,2022-06-18,Our first choice when it comes to a high-end Italian cuisine
ScottF,5,5,5,5,2022-06-16,Graduation
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-06-15,"Always great food, tastefully prepared!
Prompt service & a lovely environment"
eatsoutoften,5,5,5,5,2022-06-14,"Carmine's lists Carbonara on their menu online but it is not listed on the restaurant menu, we asked if it was possible to order it and they made it for us!  Service was excellent as usual."
KitsapTransplant,5,5,5,5,2022-06-14,Stopped for lunch on a weekday.  Food and service still excellent as always!
JoeS,5,5,5,4,2022-06-13,Outstanding service and food.  You have hired some great people.
melotxoxo,5,5,5,5,2022-06-12,Carmine’s never disappoints! I had my usual veal piccata and my husband had the Veal Chop. He said it was the best he’s ever had! Lemon meringue dessert was fabulous!
SusanC,3,2,5,5,2022-06-11,"We are regular patrons of Carmine's because the food is always  very good.  This time the lunch entrees were mediocre.  Both pasta dishes were swimming in sauce, it almost seemed like they had been sitting in the sauce for a while.
The manager did comp one of the pastas, which was nice.  
We will definitely go back as this was a one-off experience."
ScottC,5,5,5,5,2022-06-08,Excellent service and food.
KenB,5,5,5,5,2022-06-07,Charming restaurant with excellent food and superb waitstaff.
JohnH,5,5,5,5,2022-06-07,"Almost everything about this restaurant was fabulous.  Challenging at times with the noise level, but we managed.  Wonderful selection on the menu and quality excellent."
KimB,5,5,5,5,2022-06-04,Excellent all around. Some of the best Italian food I have had outside of Italy.
MattH,4,5,4,5,2022-06-04,"The woman who greeted us and sat us at our table was below what we expected. She would not smile and appeared stressed or she didn't want to be there. I asked her if she had a good day, and all I got was ""it was ok"". For the amount of money that we spent on our fabulous dinner, I was shocked to get such a cold shoulder from someone who sat us for our 23rd wedding anniversary. It just set the mood wrong for the rest of the dinner.
But our waiter was fantastic and food was beyond our expectations. Fried Calamari, Rack of Lamb and Oso Bucco were by far the best we have ever had! We will be back!"
Betty,4,4,5,3,2022-06-01,This place is very noisy. Carmines downtown  has a much quieter ambiance. Makes for better experience. They could put up something for sound attenuation which would make it more pleasant.
KitsapTransplant,5,5,5,5,2022-06-01,"After checking the menu, we asked about the soup, risotto, and fish specials.  We both chose the pan-seared halibut special, but decided to come back again for the regular items we'd missed."
Delightful,5,5,5,5,2022-05-31,Carmine's provided a lovely space for our first spring lunch on the patio!  Beautiful flower boxes and gourmet food choices. We will be back!
Maggie,5,5,5,5,2022-05-24,"As a longtime fan of the Seattle Carmine's, I was delighted to join a friend for lunch at the Bellevue location. Everything about the experience was wonderful, from the perfect service (attentive, but not overly intrusive), wonderful menu, and superb food. Perfect in every way!"
NicholasT,5,5,5,5,2022-05-20,"Phenomenal experience, Ryan was amazing, food was incredible 10/10"
Donna,5,5,5,5,2022-05-20,"Always enjoy Carmines!  Great service, delicious food, lovely atmosphere."
Dewishous,5,5,5,5,2022-05-19,Perfect for a birthday lunch celebration!
Dave,5,5,5,4,2022-05-19,"Carmine's is amazing.  On this particular occasion, a private event was held in the inside upper level of the restaurant.  As typical, folks can be pretty boisterous during such events and the bleedover of noise was unpleasant and disruptive."
MaeganO,5,5,5,5,2022-05-15,Food was amazing. Beautiful setting.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-05-14,Must go place in Bellevue
ScottC,5,5,5,5,2022-05-13,Excellent!
RobertT,4,4,4,3,2022-05-11,Carmines has come of age. It is now the equal to Il Terazzo Carmine in Seattle (owned and operated by Carmine) father of the boys who now run Carmines.  The only deficiency for seniors  like us is the noise level.
OpenTable Diner,3,4,4,4,2022-05-11,"It was unfortunate the large group behind us had no concept there were other people in the restaurant and it really, really spoiled our evening because of their loud boisterous ongoings!!  We almost had to shout to hear ourselves."
MLRSeattle,5,5,5,5,2022-05-11,Consistently great food and experience.  Always look forward to going again!
allie,5,4,5,5,2022-05-09,Excellent so enjoyed our Mother’s Day dinner together.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-05-08,"Fantastic food, desserts to die for!"
Iwus,5,5,5,5,2022-05-08,We always have a great experience but today was our second time we had Courtney as a server and she’s our favorite! All around great experience!
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,4,2022-05-06,Food is terrific. Service was good albeit a little slow. Only thing I didn’t love is that we were crammed into a tiny table that seemed like an afterthought in the dining room and it kept getting jostled by people walking by
EllenP,5,5,5,5,2022-05-05,"Carmine's Bellevue is awesome - I highly recommend it. The only ""less than perfect"" aspect is that the garage operator needs to do some serious improvement with their gate system and communication with their staff member when the exit kiosk doesn't honor the parking validation. This is not a complaint about Carmine's in any way."
PeterB,5,5,5,5,2022-05-05,"Extraordinary dining, amazing service by super star wait professionals Jeff, Miriam,Tony and Ashley.  Warmest ever greeting and reservation scheduling with super star Tasha.  Top lunch spot for business, friendship and celebrations.  Thank you to the entire family at Carmines!"
Lani,2,1,2,2,2022-05-04,"Came to celebrate a birthday.   Place was popping so very loud, could barely hear our waiter.  We ordered an appetizer but that was apparently skipped over.  Two croutons on salad?  Weird.  Filet was poorly seasoned, almost bland.  Cioppino was bland as well.   Shrimp was overcooked and not edible.   Second time dining here and service and food hasn't changed since the last time I visited.  Definitely not worth the price tag."
Swampy,5,5,5,5,2022-05-04,"The dining experience was excellent. For us, the noise level, though energetic, was quite loud making conversation difficult."
BillieO,5,5,5,5,2022-05-04,My girlfriend and I went to Carmine’s for our anniversary. It was the best experience. They treated us so nicely and made the experience very memorable. The server was outstanding. Overall 10/10 would recommend to anyone.
sailsman,5,5,5,5,2022-05-01,Work celebration
AmandaR,5,5,5,5,2022-04-30,"The food is delicious and environment is beautiful but what stood out the most was the incredible service! The servers were attentive, finely dressed and very polite. The valet was humorous, swift and organized. The hostess was informative and so friendly! We felt like even though we were having a fine dining experience, we also felt a warm welcome from beginning to end of the meal."
GeraldB,5,5,5,5,2022-04-30,"Always a treat to dine at Carmines in Bellevue!  Service always impeccable!  Food always delicious!  Even though I live in Seattle, the trek to Bellevue is always  worth it knowing the destination is Carmine’s!"
MaxK,5,5,5,5,2022-04-27,"It is hard to fully capture the ambiance of Carmines in words. I think the best way I can do it justice is saying there is charisma in the air. Everything is white linen. There is laughter and a level of joy in the air. Everyone who works here feels less like staff and more like family. There is a genuine and warm smile on the bartender, Kelen. There is an unparalleled wine knowledge and kind demeanor from the wine director, Alfredo. And the boss, Adrian, comes by to make sure you are doing ok and can make anything happen for you. Even waiters from previous visits remember you. Paulo is the kindest man I have ever met. I eat out a lot at a lot of high end restaurants every day. Carmines is one of the few restaurants I would still describe as an experience. At the end of the day, it continues to be the best on a consistent basis over anywhere else. I highly recommend the crispy calamari for an appetizer. The duck has the best cherry sauce on it I have ever tasted. For dessert I like the tiramisu! Drink wise they have a huge wine selection. For a cocktail I love the ananas. It is Titos that has been infused in pineapples for 30 days straight. Then it is shaken in a cocktail shaker and poured out for you. Amazing!"
Rego,5,5,5,5,2022-04-27,"Fantastic, The best Italian restaurant in Bellevue WA."
SarahO,5,5,5,5,2022-04-27,"Consistently great food & service. Very busy lunch rush, but everything was great!"
Godfather2022,5,5,5,5,2022-04-26,"I am never disappointed when I visit Carmines in Bellevue. I have visited Carmines on several occasions and each time I am impressed by the service and commitment to detail. If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine with amazing ambiance, Carmines delivers. This visit was no exception, dinner and service were amazing!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-04-26,"I celebrated my birthday at Carmine’s in Bellevue recently and was so impressed with the service, food and overall experience. From the fresh roses on the table to the fancy celebration dessert my evening was flawless and memorable. Have the Halibut, Ossobucco, Finocchio pasta and the Tartare. Thank you Carmines, you are simply the BEST!"
MichaelB,5,5,5,4,2022-04-26,"Excellent from start to finish! Even though it was a relatively late reservation 
(8:45) everything was on point. Our waiter (Alex) couldn't have been any nicer and the food was fantastic as usual!"
Nora,5,5,5,5,2022-04-23,Superb experience overall. Nice Italian place in Bellevue
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-04-21,"The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful, not to mention how beautiful the restaurant is! All around great dinner experience!"
Lauriek,4,5,5,4,2022-04-21,We had great food (too much!) and great service from Kat!  Will ask for a quieter table next time - we were in the middle of a major traffic lane and crammed in pretty tight with noisy neighbors.  But of course we'll be back - it's excellent!
ScottC,5,5,5,5,2022-04-19,Excellent service and meal.
DonaldR,5,5,5,4,2022-04-16,"An amazing meal. Because this establishment is so busy, I only get this experience 4 or 5 times a year."
Michele,5,5,5,5,2022-04-16,"Delicious food as always!!  Insalata di Maria’s grilled salmon is excellent!  Instead of sitting inside where it’s pretty noisy, opted to sit out on their covered patio with heat lamps…very comfortable for a chilly but clear day!!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-04-16,Our first time here so not sure what to expect but was more than happy with the atmosphere and dining experience. Dodd was wonderful and the service was exceptional. Will definitely come back!
ShirleyK,5,5,5,5,2022-04-15,We love Carmines it’s one of our favorite restaurants. We always have great service & the food is always great & consistent. Everything is always perfect.
JuJuW,4,4,5,5,2022-04-14,"Always love coming here. The risotto and rigatoni bolognese were excellent as usual. My husband has the prime beef tenderloin with gnocchi and the beef was superb, better than the steak restaurants, but the gnocchi and green beans were over-cooked. Gnocchi was mushy so we didn't eat those and the green beans were soft and not crunchy. I would still go back."
CarolG,4,5,5,5,2022-04-13,I was surprised when we were told that people with a reservation were now waiting for our table and basically we needed to pack up. We were just about ready to leave but it was not what I would have expected at Carmine’s
ChrisT,5,5,5,5,2022-04-13,Love it always.
wolfehunters,5,5,5,5,2022-04-09,"It was quiet at first then got noisier as the night wore on. Very attentive service, nice ambience, great drinks and deliciously prepared food. Definitely will be back next time we are in the area."
Leesh,5,5,5,5,2022-04-08,"I’ve been here 3 times in the last month. By far some of the best service I’ve received in Bellevue. All 3 times I had incredible servers/bartenders, who you can tell love what they do. They were incredibly kind, honestly hilarious and truly cared about your experience. The espresso martinis are incredible, their pasta is great, and their spinach ricotta stuffed chicken was sooo good! They have a lemon dessert that literally melts in your mouth, the freshest lemon taste honestly. They also have a bread pudding that has chocolate chips instead of raisins (who likes raisins?) so that made me happy! Come here."
Anna,5,5,5,5,2022-04-07,Took my grandma out to Carmines for her birthday. We loved it. We arrived at 5pm right when it opened so it was still quiet and only later did it get more noisy. The service was amazing. We were served by a kind blonde woman who was very good at what she does. We love the feel of the place and I'll definitely be back.
SamanthaD,5,5,5,5,2022-04-06,Took my friend for her birthday and we had the best time. Our server was great and the food was amazing!
CatieL,5,5,5,5,2022-03-27,Great service as always. They really have such a great wait staff.
LinaM,5,5,5,5,2022-03-26,Paolo is the best!! Food was yummy and I was happy to have some laughs with my best friends
Lhseattle,4,5,5,5,2022-03-26,"Beautiful covered heated outdoor patio with luxurious linens. Delicious food. Lengthy wine list but several of the wines we were interested in were not available. Service was good, attentive. They made us feel special on our anniversary"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2022-03-26,"We sat outside—any noise is from the street.  We had a great table, the service was excellent from our first drinks to dessert.  The food was excellent as always, and they’re always solicitous with excellent picks for wines by the glass if we don’t want a bottle.  The bar drinks were spot on.  Always a consistent."
PAULM,5,5,5,5,2022-03-26,"Fabulous, modern, fresh, and tasty. This was our first time at Carmine but definitely not the last."
KathleenC,5,5,4,4,2022-03-23,Beautiful setting for wonderful food and gracious service!
TiffanyM,5,5,5,5,2022-03-23,"I have never walked away from Carmine’s disappointed. The food is consistently excellent, service on point, and warm ambience. I love it!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-03-19,Unique and delicious food. Love this as a brunch spot due to the amount of food and ambiance.
Dutchy,5,5,5,5,2022-03-17,My girls and I come here a lot but this visit was with the girls and my granddaughter whom is 5.5 years old and it was her first girls lunch.  The staff made it special and wonderful.  And next time she is in town we will do again.  Thank you for making her first experience delightful
StephanieK,5,5,5,5,2022-03-16,Fantastic birthday dinner. Service was impeccable. Meals were superb. Loved the energy of everyone dining out again. Delightful evening!
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,5,2022-03-16,Two birthdays to celebrate. Mid afternoon in the bar corner table. Perfect - and thank you for the birthday dessert!!
AndrewC,5,1,5,5,2022-03-15,"Great service in a beautiful and elegant space. Very good if not perfect food. Rather noisy and energetic during the dinner rush, so try to dine a bit late if you want a more intimate setting."
LynnV,4,5,5,4,2022-03-15,"My husband’s beef tenderloin was done perfectly. 
My squid ink capellini was just a bit over cooked, but the dish was delicious. 
Our waiter, Alexander, was excellent, and all the staff were very professional.  
This was our first visit and the ambience was very energized. It is the first week that the pandemic mask mandate has been lifted and may have explained why every table was full.  The tables were very close to each other, and it was very difficult to have a conversation due to the noise of a full, busy restaurant. If you want a quiet personal dinner, this is not the place to go, but otherwise, I would recommend it."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2022-03-15,"Always amazing, staff is always amazing, what can I say the restaurant is always amazing I have never been disappointed I’m a regular."
Tiffy,5,5,5,5,2022-03-13,Wonderful food and ambiance and service was fantastic!  Definitely made the birthday celebration special in every way from the birthday sign to the signature dessert.  This was the first time we visited and will definitely be back!  Many thanks for making our evening so special!

AnnD,5,5,5,5,2022-03-10,A treat for lunch and a great place for business meetings.  The bread is too good to pass up - even though the calories add up!
luckylindy98072,4,3,5,5,2022-03-10,My cioppino was not very good. The calamari and shrimp were like hard rubber. This was my first bad food experience at Carmines.
Edwards,5,5,5,4,2022-03-05,"Too much noise, tables very close to each other, makes difficult to have a conversation without talking out loud.

Besides that, the food was great and the service as well."
SachinD,5,4,5,5,2022-03-04,Had a great time on our first wedding anniversary

TicaG,5,5,5,5,2022-03-01,"Our server was exceptional and the food was heavenly. I had the osso bucco and my husband had the cannelloni, both so yummy. We ate inside but next time we will try the lovely patio. The whole experience was wonderful."
OpenTable Diner,4,4,4,4,2022-02-26,"Happy to be back to lunch with friends after 2 years!  Lively ambience, great service.  Sea bass was a bit too salty for me.  Otherwise great place for meet up."
CAdams,5,5,5,5,2022-02-25,"This restaurant always exceeds any wonderful food and service expectation we could ever have.  Coco (a very nice assistant manager) was our server.  She is so sweet and gave us the most amazing service.  Thank you Coco, and thank all of you at Carmine’s for making every meal there such a relaxing, wonderful and very special experience.  Your place is beautiful and it is clear you all have attention to detail in the table setting, decor and everything there.  Your restaurant is my very favorite restaurant in the entire Seattle area, and I know several other people who have said the same thing."
Laurenhut,5,5,5,4,2022-02-24,"Went for a business lunch. Restaurant was not crowded and tables are large. I

JeffH,5,5,5,5,2022-02-17,"Carmine’s never disappoints. The food, service and wine selection are top notch. We will certainly be returning!"
Anna,5,5,5,5,2022-02-17,"We split the two lunch specials (Sea Bass and Risotto) and both dishes were excellent. Cooked perfectly and superb flavors. We both thought the food was the best we've memorably had, and the ambiance and service were both top-notch. Highly recommend."
OpenTable Diner,4,4,4,5,2022-02-16,"Enjoyed a belated Valentine’s Day Dinner the day after Valentine’s Day. The valet service they have available are polite & courteous & the service doesn’t cost much at all (highly suggested)!!! Our entire meal came in a timely fashion considering how packed the restaurant was. The bruschetta was bit tough but other than that we had zero complaints on the food! Our waiter was super energetic and attentive & couldn’t have been better, all in all, definitely a great place to enjoy a late Valentine’s Day meal with your lover!!"

KatieS,5,5,5,5,2022-02-02,Few restaurants in the city have the same level of service and attention to detail Carmine's provides. Another great visit. Highly recommend.
jamiel,5,5,5,5,2022-01-28,Had a wonderful evening celebrating a special birthday.  The food was amazing.  The wait staff was wonderful.  All around five star.
Carol,4,5,5,2,2022-01-27,"For a weekday night it was very crowded.  My chair was in waiter's path as well as other diners' path.  Noise level made it difficult to converse.  Food, service, parking and location were excellent."

Zorro,4,4,3,5,2022-01-22,"I always enjoy dining at Carmine’s!  I invited a friend to a late lunch.  We ordered the mushroom risotto and shrimp pesto pasta, they were both excellent!  The panzanella salad was ok, I think they forgot dressing and not much bread. We had to ask for a basket of bread and for drink refills.  We felt like we were an afterthought.  Maybe they were setting up for dinner?  The service definitely wasn’t the best that I have had. Disappointed!"
JanA,4,4,4,5,2022-01-22,"I brought a good friend of mine to the restaurant for her birthday lunch.  Unfortunately she had ordered the clams with Linguine meal and it had sand in the clams, which she realized as she took her first bite of her meal.  I felt bad, but do realize that sometimes this type of thing to happen, but I was sorry it happened to the birthday girl!  She then ordered the Eggplant Parmesan which she enjoyed very much.   I have brought many people to the restaurant in the past and have never had a problem and just hope we will not have that problem again."
bhcho,5,4,5,4,2022-01-20,The food is above average. Thought is was a bit too noisy.

kenp,5,5,5,5,2022-01-19,"Carmine's food and service make for a great experience. Coming from the east coast I more than appreciate a good Italian meal. Carmine's does not disappoint in that regard. The Eggplant Parm as an appetizer is about as good as it gets. Last night I had the Osso Bucco which is one of the many fine choices on the menu. Have a nice bottle of wine with your meal and when you get the check, you at least feel the meal was was the price. As an fyi, the liquor as in most restaurants is what jacks the price up but this is a business so expect the added expense."

the ambience especially in the bar

EvaP,5,5,5,5,2022-01-14,Amazing server! Her name is Pat and she is really good at what she does! My kids gave her a compliment how nice she is and thanked her for doing a great job with us! Super contagious that makes our evening fun.
BarrieG,5,5,5,5,2022-01-11,Out of town friends
ThomasKellerwannaBe,5,5,3,2,2022-01-08,"The day we went, service was VERY SLOW for lunch.  The customers at lunch tend to be Bellevue Real estate women, bleach blond, drink way too much, and laugh as loud as they can like hyenas.  A really pleasant ambiance.  The food is always exquisitely made and tasty.  Wine list massive and good."
Lauriek,4,4,5,5,2022-01-07,My entree was excellent but my husband had the rib eye special and half of it was fat.  He was very disappointed - especially for a $70 steak!
desmond,5,5,5,4,2022-01-05,"Pablo and Roberto were very friendly, professional, and provided best customer service. The Ossobuco and scaloppine veal were delicious. The whole dining experience was fantastic!"

Foodie,5,4,5,5,2021-12-29,Everything was exceptional except the Bass special.  It wasn't that good.  Neither was the pasta that came with it.
jmas,5,5,5,5,2021-12-23,Wonderful holiday celebration lunch.  Amazing crab risotto!
Steve,5,5,5,5,2021-12-22,"Carmine's is always a good bet for food, service and ambience. Conveniently located in Old Downtown Bellevue, it is in a perfect location for meeting friends, family and business partners. The menu is widely varied Italian with something for every taste.
We go quite regularly and are never disappointed."
PeterB,5,5,5,5,2021-12-22,Exceptional wow by table server Miriam! Always amazing warmth and engagement from the super star hostess and her team. Food is fabulous and the experience exceptional!

NancyD,5,5,5,5,2021-12-12,Our fist time here.  Excellent food service and atmosphere. I can’t wait to go back.
grace2000,2,3,1,2,2021-12-12,Always a pleasure. This time was not the case. My fault. I was not attentive to the price of drinks and wine. Assumed server was offering reasonably  priced beverages. Glass of rose $34!  Not assume. Check price!
Crystal,4,2,5,4,2021-12-11,"I think we showed up on a busy day. The risotto was under cooked as well as the gnocchi. Both items I've ordered before. It was an off night, I think"
Foodie,3,5,3,4,2021-12-11,Love Carmines but service was a bit off today. A bit forced effort on wait staff but we will certainly return for another chance.
Rahul,4,4,4,3,2021-12-10,Food was amazing! I would love to come here again :)
TatyanaZ,5,5,5,5,2021-12-10,We had a great experience at Carmine’s. Our server was amazing and took good care of us. She took the initiative and got us a tiramisu with a candle for my husbands birthday. Always an amazing experience visiting Carmine’s. Will be coming back again soon!
Dutchy,5,5,5,5,2021-12-09,This is about girls group place!  We are always happy with the food and service!

MariM,4,5,5,2,2021-12-07,"Food was fabulous. Our seating, with reservation well in advance, was disappointing. There were seven of us; 5 seniors. We were seated on a a long booth with tables pushed together. Made it very difficult for those seated on the booth section to exit/enter the space.  Plus the large cushions on the corner added to the challenge. For this size party, booking so far in advance, a free standing table would have been  much better. Plus near the kitchen so pretty loud for the first hour or so."
JohnO,5,5,5,5,2021-12-03,Always awake
BruceL,5,5,5,5,2021-12-03,"Carmine's has been the quintessential go to spot for fine Italian dinning for decades starting in Seattle. The Bellevue location is beautiful and Adrian and his team are the best of the best. The service, food and ambiance are unrivaled in my opinion."
Karen,5,5,5,5,2021-11-28,Amazing experience!!!!
JennyL,5,5,5,3,2021-11-23,"The waiter was very friendly and helpful in food selection. The food, both the eggplant parm and venison were absolutely heavenly. Only concern that we had was that they didn’t ask to see our vaccination record. Not the person before us either. Bummer."
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,5,2021-11-20,Excellent!!! The only problem is having very high noise level
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-11-20,Friends get together for bdays
Greg,5,4,5,4,2021-11-20,Great salmon salad!  Highly recommend that.  And the tiramisu was perfect!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-11-19,"Excellent food, service and ambience.  Never disappoints.  Great place to celebrate special occasions."
KathrynH,5,5,5,5,2021-11-19,Excellent covered patio area with heaters for outdoor dining.
JayYi,4,2,5,5,2021-11-18,Food is usually spot on here. The pesto pasta amazing as usual. The lamb was tough and not seasoned enough. By the time our server checked on us my partner finished his food because he was starving. I left 80% of the lamb on the plate because it was not the quality I expected. I don’t know if it was the lamb or the cook but it’s made me question ordering the non-pasta items there.
Franbolini,4,4,3,4,2021-11-17,"The salmon and pizza were excellent, the tenderloin was just okay for the price, especially when there are a dozen excellent steak restaurants in the area. It is indeed super loud in the restaurant. The patio looked adorable and cozy but was filled. The waiter had a bit of an attitude when the steak needed to be sent back as we ordered it between medium and medium-rare and it was literally almost raw. He did bring it back with an extra portion of sides so that was nice. The people at the front and who I think were the owners/managers were exceptionally friendly and grateful."
Foodfan,5,5,4,5,2021-11-16,"Best restaurant in Bellevue, hands down. But they weren't checking vaccine cards which was very concerning."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-11-12,Excellent food and services!
todd,2,3,2,3,2021-11-12,"I've been to Carmines before but this last visit was very disappointing. The service was incredibly slow and somewhat rude. When we first sat down and ordered our drinks (wine), we received one glass that wasn't what we ordered. It was an $18 glass of wine. When we said we didn't like it, we were just told that that's what they have. We didn't even feel like we could order a different glass. Then during the meal, we were never asked if we wanted more drinks. Also, our food sat on the table for at least 20 minutes before anybody came and took it or bagged it to go. Then the Birthday dessert came before we were even offered the opportunity to order other desserts for the table. When we did order more, the waiter looked annoyed and told us what we wanted could take 20 minutes so maybe order something different. It almost felt like we were being ignored a little bit. Not great for what you pay to go there. Also, it is incredibly loud in the restaurant."
EricA,5,5,5,5,2021-11-10,Everything was great except the driving rain outside.
Staci,5,5,5,5,2021-11-09,We had a FANTASTIC dinner at Carmine’s. Wonderful service and atmosphere. The food was outstanding!!!!!!!

SarahB,5,5,5,5,2021-11-06,We have been to Carmines on several occasions and have always enjoyed the food and excellent service. The waiter also gave us a suggestion for a bottle of wine that was the perfect complement to the meal.
hermitage67,5,5,5,5,2021-11-06,Always great.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-11-04,Our favorite special place to gather in Bellevue!

KentoB,5,5,5,5,2021-11-02,"My girlfriend and I went to Carmines for our anniversary. We had a good time and the food was delicious, especially the desserts."
HannahM,5,5,5,4,2021-11-02,"I absolutely love this restaurant. It is a bit pricey, but I think that it is worth it for the quality of food. Finally tried their steak (beef tenderloin) and it was amazing! Their gnocchi is the softest I’ve ever tried, and I order every time I visit.  All the staff are always very nice and attentive, and have great recommendations."
OpenTable Diner,3,2,4,2,2021-11-02,Better seating next time would be great.
MIHS,5,5,4,4,2021-10-31,"The food here is amazing! The preparation and flavor of each dish is unique, mouthwatering and delicious. We love dining here and look forward to our next visit."
RuthS,2,3,1,1,2021-10-30,"Shame on Carmine's !  Did not check for proof of COVID 19 vaccination as they are required to do by law. Tables very close together. Noise level unpleasant.   Food is average northern Italian fare ... very little finesse to the presentation.  Service was poor.  Long wait to get any attention  to start our ordering,  Waiter was rather abrupt,  impatient.  Restaurant was very busy ... seems to be a gold mine so perhaps they don't think they need to try very hard to provide an enjoyable dining experience or be COVID compliant."
ErinA,5,5,5,5,2021-10-29,Always excellent at Carmine’s. We went for a friend’s birthday. Everything was perfect and our waiter was wonderful…a treat you don’t always get in Seattle so it feels that much more special.
karanD,5,5,5,5,2021-10-29,It’s always consistently good food great service love it there
JohnK,5,5,5,4,2021-10-28,Excellent food & service.   Would certainly recommend as a top-tier Italian restaurant.
Jeffrey,5,5,5,5,2021-10-27,"Great place for special event, attention to detail by everyone."
hithit,5,5,5,3,2021-10-24,"world's loudest ppl sat next to us, was so annoying since i could hear nothing"
OpenTable Diner,3,2,5,4,2021-10-24,I was very excited to to try this restaurant. I read reviews and based on how difficult it was to get reservation I thought this place would blow me away. Oh I was so wrong. I do want to point out the service was good but what disappointed was the food. For the appetizer we got sautéed calamari which was good but nothing that I would rave about. For entree I ordered a duck breast and that is when the meal went wrong. I asked for medium prepared  and what I got is a raw piece of duck breast which tasted like raw meat and was so chewy. Of course my husband told the waiter about  it and they tried to fix it by overcooking the duck to the point it had no juices left and tasted dry and flavorless. It was very disappointing. I couldn’t eat it. And of course they charged me for this expensive entree that I couldn’t eat. To try to make us feel better they didn’t charge us for a desert my husband and I shared. Overall it was a disappointing experience for us.
Victoria,5,4,5,5,2021-10-23,Gnocchi falls apart in your mouth! So delicious !! Great service !
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,4,2021-10-21,Meals and services are always good… so as the noise level is going higher and higher… only drawback….
JenK,5,5,5,4,2021-10-21,We had a wonderful birthday dinner at Carmine's. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. The food was delicious.  My daughter and I both wanted something that was not on the menu and the server was happy to accommodate us.
Anne,5,5,5,5,2021-10-19,"The cannelloni were melt in your mouth delicious.!

Our server whose name I’m sorry to forget was very attentive.

Can’t wait til the next occasion."

please bring the filet to the lunch menu! ;)"
PAVELD,4,5,3,4,2021-10-13,"Pretty busy place, really good food and nice interior. The food order took a bit too long to come (~30-40 mins)."
JM7609,5,3,5,5,2021-10-13,"The Panzanella salad with chicken I ordered for lunch was underwhelming with roughly two ounces of chicken, hardly any bread or tomatoes. No basil,  loads upon loads of romaine. I would not order it again. That said, the Capresse Salad for start was excellent, but would be improved with sea salt. Tiramisu was delicious for dessert, but coffee was very disappointing (overly roasted and lukewarm) for such a visually lovely atmosphere."
CurtisJ,5,5,5,5,2021-10-09,Amazing food and great service!!!
MaryAustin,5,5,5,5,2021-10-09,Our second visit. Returned to take our grown sons. We had another great time.
Flyhigh,5,5,5,5,2021-10-07,I dine at Carmines often and I aways get a wonderful meal.  Pick a special of the chef.  It should be ourstanding.  Seattle or Bellevue.  It's wonderful.
Foodie2,5,5,5,5,2021-10-06,"My husband and I love eating at Carmine’s. The food is excellent, the staff is friendly and attentive. Roberto was incredible. But the gnocchi is off the charts!!"
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,4,2021-10-05,Excellent service and food. Restaurant was loud  and it was hard to hear my husband so we sat next to each other at the table.
CoffeeMaven,5,5,5,5,2021-09-29,Great food and service.  The pasta was Al dente and delicious! My favorite lunch at my favorite restaurant. EXCELLENT!
Missy,5,5,5,5,2021-09-28,"My favorite Eastside restaurant!  Lunch and dinner choices are awesome; makes deciding difficult.  I was having lunch with my sister and debated over the daily special Chilean Sea Bass in an awesome butter sauce with linguine on the side OR the menu offers linguine with fresh Manila Clams which I love.  The special won out.  My sister enjoyed her Eggplant baked with tomato sauce and mozzarella.  

Service was fun.  They took good care of us.  We were both celebrating our birthdays and they surprised us by serving each of us a delicious tiramisu, happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate, and a birthday candle so we could each make a wish.  What a wonderful afternoon!"
SarahN,4,4,4,5,2021-09-27,Beautiful location…good and service were good but have room for improvement.  Charging $6 for a kids’ Diet Coke is highway robbery.  And I have two kids.
PaulM,5,5,5,5,2021-09-26,Very romantic setting with superb cuisine!
lsw86009,5,5,5,5,2021-09-25,"A real gem in Bellevue.

DonaldR,5,5,5,5,2021-09-25,Another top notch dinner for a much needed out out. Every item on the menu exceeds expectations.  Want to make this a regular night out for us.
MaryAustin,5,5,5,5,2021-09-24,The food was AMAZING. The service was great! We cannot wait to go back.

NeerajS,3,3,3,4,2021-09-15,Food was pretty heavy (oily and lots of cheese)  OpenTable declined my request for changing reservation from 3 to 4.  However when I went to the restaurant I was given a table for 4.  Disappointing.

JessicaS,5,4,4,4,2021-09-15,"bread pudding was to die for! pastas were overall good but not as authentic as hoped, friendly staff and good place for family, they were very kind and flexible with reservations."
WaGal,4,5,4,4,2021-09-12,"Asked multiple times for more butter.  Food was great.  My biggest beef was that I ordered a Cosmo, and when we got the bill I found an up charge to use Grey Goose. And I definitely did not request premium vodka for a Cosmo. Have never had that substitution before.  Crab risotto was divine."
Retired,5,5,5,5,2021-09-12,"Carmine’s is one of  our favorite places to go.  The food, staff and ambiance and the best.  We had dinner for our 45th anniversary yesterday.  This is our 5 year in a row celebrating here.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."

KorinaH,5,5,5,4,2021-09-02,"The food was great, very flavorful. The wine was also delicious and our waiter ensured our glasses were always filled which was nice. We wrote a note that it was our anniversary and the restaurant really made us feel special. Upon arriving we were told happy anniversary, had a card at our table, and received complimentary tiramisu with happy anniversary written on it. 

It was very loud though so it was hard to have a conversation. Overall I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion"
AllaP,5,5,5,5,2021-09-02,"It was our first time at this restaurant.  None of the people in my group expected it to be that great!  Anything, you name it, sitting, food, service, all outstanding!  It was really hard to get reservation for the time we wanted, and now we understood why. A special thanks to our waitress, who was so attentive and accurate with orders. I really recommend Carmine's to anybody."

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-08-25,Phenomenal
OpenTable Diner,3,5,1,5,2021-08-22,Got seated around 855pm and received our food at 10:45. I feel like the service has declined over the year but perhaps it’s server based only. An apology or a quick explanation as to why the wait was so long would be appreciated when tables near by were served promptly but we heard nothing.
jayk,5,5,5,5,2021-08-20,That was great to see people were enjoying just been there ..And Carmine's food was fantastic. Additionaly  there is outside table option. Highly recommend it.

OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,5,2021-08-17,Last year for my wife’s birthday was amazing the management was on top of it he came twice to check up on us and bought around on the house!! Adrian Lopez was the manager LAST YEARS. Dinner last night was average to our stander our waitress was terrible I normally don’t like using that word in a very reasonable person but I felt that she rushed the order and they were check back on especially for drinks even if she was waiting for the little dessert for my wife’s birthday she could’ve came over and make sure that we were taken care of as far as drinks or something else again very disappointed for the money that we spent

Everything else was great"
Aiyo,5,5,5,5,2021-08-11,"This was a surprise birthday lunch for my boyfriend. The safe was very friendly, the food was AMAZING. 

We got the bolognese, and spaghetti di finoccio (sp?). Both dishes were delicious, robust, and overall a delight. The food is worth every dollar spent. 

While we would probably only go for special occasions, we are definitely trying to find more special occasions to have in order to go back ;)"

Tifa,3,3,2,4,2021-08-10,"We went for a little birthday lunch. We were sat in the bar. I’ve been to carmine many times. But this was the worst service. Our knives were taken away after the bread and butter. It was hard to eat/ cut shrimp with a spoon!! Our waiter was hard to find/ reach. 

We also got the flattest cappuccinos with no foams. It was the worst lunch we had at carmine to date."

MidoriS,5,5,5,5,2021-07-28,"Always a great place to go for dinner!  Great food, great service and good ambiance."
RobertM,4,4,5,4,2021-07-28,Roberto always makes our visits wonderful! Carmine's is favorite place in Bellevue to celebrate birthdays and anniversary.  We can always count on great food and service.
OpenTable Diner,3,2,2,4,2021-07-27,"I absolutely don’t understand the fascination with Carmines. The ambiance and location are great, but that’s about it. The service is dreadfully slow, the food just mediocre, and the price very high. My partner had osso bucco and it wasn’t cooked long enough to be tender. I had the bolognese and it legitimately tasted like chef boyardee from my childhood. The bread was good and the Caprese starter too, but short of those items we left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. We likely won’t be back."
gjoe,4,4,5,4,2021-07-27,"We were so pleased with the service. We were late due to our poor planning, they were so nice to accommodate us with the same table as we reserved. Our waitress who only works on Monday, was wonderful.  This was such a contrast to the night before at Ascend where we were just a number, our evening ruined by a manager.  We have patronized the Seattle location for years, it is nice to see how customer service has continued at this location.  I would like to have a few more truly Italian entrees but the food was still very good.  We will be back!"
RileyW,2,1,3,5,2021-07-27,"No hate, nothing about the server or the place because both were very nice and good. But the food was actually just disgusting… Had high hopes and it just wasn’t good"
PlaneJ,5,5,5,5,2021-07-27,"Carmine's is a go-to for fine food.  The service is impeccable, the ambiance is wonderful. The food is true Italian cuisine."
What,5,5,5,5,2021-07-25,Waitress was so lovely and informed. Ambience can’t be beat and the food was great.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,4,5,2021-07-24,Eduardo was really busy and he was quite attentive to us. Thank you
JDELEON,5,4,4,5,2021-07-22,Hobert and Hugo rendered such beautiful and excellent service!
David,5,5,5,5,2021-07-22,"Ate here for our Wedding Anniversary. Had two other tables celebrating anniversaries and two celebrating birthdays! This is the place to celebrate! Everything was spot on, a real classy yet friendly treat."
barbara,5,5,5,5,2021-07-21,Great B Day dinner for my husband! Hugo waited on us he was amazing as was the food!
WendeW,5,5,5,5,2021-07-20,"I love Carmine's - I always expect a beautiful atmosphere, top notch service, and delicious food, and that's exactly what I got during my recent lunch there. The halibut special was so good, I'll be craving it again. Fresh roses on every table was a nice touch. Topped it off with a perfect cappuccino. I'll be back - maybe on the beautiful patio next time!"
Meredith,5,5,5,5,2021-07-20,"Best Italian restaurant on the eastside! Great food, great wine list and excellent cocktails!"
adelaidaa,5,5,5,5,2021-07-20,Best Italian in Bellevue
redmond,3,4,2,4,2021-07-17,Food and ambiance very good as always but service/staffing and kitchen speed not good at all. Perhaps our waiter nice enough fellow had too many tables. Service was very slow and inattentive. They also seem to have an issue of not having white wines properly chilled on our last 2 visits.
WarrenM,5,5,5,4,2021-07-16,"Our group of 6 had an amazing dinner at Carmines as usual. My reservation was for 5, but we showed up with 6, and they quickly accommodated us with a table. We brought wine and Rose which they chilled quickly and served them all. Our Apps were delicious, and main courses and desserts were superb! I always enjoy my overall experience at Carmines. A first class operation!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-07-16,Birthday celebration
betsy,4,5,5,3,2021-07-16,"We ordered our entrees, the server said he will bring a small plate of Rossotto( making it sound like it is complimentary ) I was charged $22 for it, not good PR. Also there is a $3 charge in my account, no idea what it is about. 
It the best Halibut I have ever eaten.    Betsy gruber4257467707.  I am new in the area"
MIHS,5,5,4,4,2021-07-15,Love this restaurant! Make a reservation well in advance!

Duke,3,2,5,4,2021-07-11,"Nice place and location. Food quality not so good, my duck was chewy and overall very expensive for what you get."
RubyD,5,5,5,5,2021-07-10,"I mistakenly made my reservation for the day ahead of my intended reservation, it was my birthday and they were able to accommodate us even though they were booked. Always consistent food and service! Love it!"
JoeS,5,5,5,4,2021-07-10,Amazing food and great service.  It always this way!
Misschristie,4,5,3,3,2021-07-09,The service was incredibly slow.  The birthday touches were very much appreciated.
Laurie,5,5,5,5,2021-07-08,Wonderful restaurant.  The proximity to the Dowyown Bellevue Park makes it even more special.
ulike2dine,5,5,5,5,2021-07-08,Absolutely delicious food.  Our waiter was outstanding too.
epmf,5,5,5,5,2021-07-06,We loved our lunch on the patio!  Highly recommend Insalata Di Maria. The salmon was cooked to perfection!

Sylvester77,5,5,5,5,2021-07-01,"The food was amazing, our waiter was great! Definitely will be coming back!! Highly recommend!"
MaxK,5,5,5,5,2021-06-30,"Carmines has quickly been the finest place to go to post-covid. The ambiance can only be described as exquisite. I eat out… way too much… and there is just something at Carmines that leaves you with an air of enchantment. The manager, Adrian is the most amazing person you will ever meet! He is the kind of guy that turns a normal day into a special occasion. He makes Carmines go from great to my favorite! Last night I had the good fortune of Coco being our waitress and I felt like we were best friends by the end of the night. She was absolutely phenomenal and treated my friend and I like we were family.  Food wise, if you like duck I highly recommend the duck. It is a delight to the senses with its slight bourbon cherry sauce coating. My second favorite is the filet mignon with gnocchi. I don’t even normally get filets but this one is out of this world. The pine nuts on the top give it a slight crunch that pairs perfectly with the steak. If you are looking for pasta I recommend the gnocchi in brown butter, it is to die for. In terms of drinks you need to try their ananas. It is Titos infused with fresh pineapples for an entire month. There is no vodka flavor, only a refreshing relish of pineapple. If you like mezcal, the mezcal sour is also a joy to the senses! The wine selection is also out of this world. I constantly get a different bottle and am always amazed with the diversity of fantastic wines they have! For dessert my two favorites are the semifreddo (mostly frozen, very rich chocolate) and spumoni ice cream (which has those amazing bourbon cherries on top). This has quickly become my favorite restaurant and I am here far more often than I should admit! I hope you love this place as much as I do!"
MaryG,5,5,5,3,2021-06-30,"Yummy food, great service! Our favorite in Bellevue"
eatsoutoften,5,4,5,4,2021-06-30,"Our server was great, she was very patient with our party of 3.  We hadn't seen each other for over a year so it took awhile for us to order our meals.  Food and service here are always top notch!"
BruceS,5,5,5,5,2021-06-29,Amazing food in a beautiful restaurant with exceptional service! Always a wonderful experience.
Velastar,5,5,5,5,2021-06-27,"While it was 95 degrees outside, we we cool
and comfortable inside at a beautiful table with amazing service and impeccable

deliver it."

The food was fantastic. Overall great experience!"
desmond,5,4,5,5,2021-06-17,Alexis was very pleasant and provided excellent service. We love it
OpenTable Diner,3,4,4,2,2021-06-16,It was so loud we had trouble hearing conversations at our table.  Two of our six entrees were not what we ordered.  The server was good but seemed overloaded.  They were very busy.
Margie,5,5,5,5,2021-06-16,"Good food, skilled service, wonderful ambiance and location. Margie Bloch"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-06-16,Carmine’s Bellevue is now my go to lunch spot. Great for treating a client or just networking.
AA1994,5,5,5,5,2021-06-15,It’s an awesome Italian place for a birthday dinner
Sfrench,5,4,5,5,2021-06-13,Hustle bustle good vibe and excellent service.  Classic Italian done very well.
datenightdiner,4,5,5,3,2021-06-13,very good food and service; very busy and a bit noisy
Beebman,5,5,5,5,2021-06-13,"Our favorite restaurant on the Eastside.  Great food, wonderful staff, just an overall great experience every time we dine there."
Fred,4,4,4,4,2021-06-10,"Enjoyed a very good lunch with old friends.  Unfortunately, it was very noisy."
Bellevuemommy,1,2,1,1,2021-06-09,"I’ve heard the good thing about this restaurant but I was really disappointed.  Overall, service was so slow and it took 40min for the first dish to be served.  More importantly, we weren’t feeling comfortable that servers don’t wear mask and talk too closely to our foods or drinks even if we are fully vaccinated.

I don’t think I will visit here again."
ErikaF,5,5,4,5,2021-06-09,"The food is very tasty, the ambiance is impeccable and the service is good! For the price of what you’re getting you definitely get more of what you pay for. Easily one of the best Italian restaurants in the area."
AprilS,4,4,5,4,2021-06-08,"The service and food was great but the atmosphere was noisy.  It was difficult to hear the 4 of us around the small table.  They treated us to a special dessert for our anniversary but wish we would have been seated at a quieter, more secluded area of restaurant."
eatup,5,5,5,5,2021-06-07,Always great food and wonderful service! We like the tables in the bar.
OpenTable Diner,3,4,3,5,2021-06-06,Food and ambiance was good but the service was not up to the mark. The waiter was going to interest with the specials of the day and when he heard we don’t eat fish/ pork/ beef then the person suddenly stopped and didn’t show interest in neither taking order or serving it. Other wise food was okay!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-06-05,As always Carmines has delivered on absolute excellence. They have innovated well throughout Covid and maintained quality of food and service. What an amazing dinner!
MelissaW,5,5,5,5,2021-06-05,The rigatoni was delicious as was the prawns in tomato primavera
MfLf,5,5,5,5,2021-06-05,Very nice evening. Good food
HollyM,5,5,5,5,2021-06-03,"The full package....great menu, service, ambiance and location!"
Missy,5,5,5,5,2021-06-02,"Carmine’s is a great place to dine! They make you feel so welcome.  The hostess, wait staff, bartender are all at your beck and call to assure you have an awesome dinner. We had a birthday celebration at our table and were pleasantly surprised with tiramisu for the celebration. It’s always hard to decide what to order because there’s so many good things on the menu. This evening we had the duck breast, oven roasted, Confitura Leg with Amarena Cherries and duck jus with risotto and broccolini. The duck was wonderful.  the Caesar salad before the duck was awesome too.  Great dressing and crisp romaine.  Highly recommend…….my favorite!"
GordonS,5,5,5,5,2021-05-29,"The noise level, according to the opentable description says “energetic”. Please read that as, it was incredibly loud to the point I had a hard time hearing my wife over the noise. I’m also not old, so it’s not like I just have bad hearing. It was so loud. Could it have been mostly the table of 7 rich AF old white dudes playing credit card roulette at a table a ways away? Probably a lot of that. But it was loud from all directions. I’d rather come back at a quieter time as the food was excellent."
winegirl,5,5,5,5,2021-05-29,"It was so nice to finally be able to go out with friends. Our server was Luis, and he was fantastic."
OpenTable Diner,4,3,3,4,2021-05-29,Six year old birthday lunch
Bluewa,5,5,5,5,2021-05-28,Great glad to be back
Fablok,5,5,5,5,2021-05-27,"We’ve been to the Carmines downtown many times, but this was our first time dining in Bellevue.  Happily, the food and service were every bit as excellent.  They have a party room in the back and a nice patio for summer evenings.  Valet parking was appreciated.  

We started with a bruschetta trio - six pieces.  Each one was very unique and tasty.  The venison ravioli are  too good to pass up. The risotto that night was a crab and crepe fraiche with asparagus.  Perfect!  Lamb cops were also nicely grilled.  Get a delicious dessert and walk it off in the park across the street."
LindaLu,5,5,5,5,2021-05-27,"My husband, daughter and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Carmine’s.  Two of us started with a Caesar salad: the romaine was crisp-like and the dressing has to be the best around. My husband chose the Spinaci Soffritti which is fresh spinach lightly sautéed with lemon and garlic. So delicious! Our main dishes (mushroom risotto, halibut sautéed with lemon and capers with pasta, and grilled veal rib with rosemary and risotto) were exactly as we expected: perfectly prepared and delicious!  We are looking forward to returning this weekend for dinner with our friends."
SteveD,5,5,5,5,2021-05-25,"We had a fabulous birthday celebration for my wife. Drinks, appetizers, pasta entrees and desserts were all awesome."
Raghu,5,5,5,5,2021-05-25,"The pasta there is top notch. Pizza was ok, the steam fried veggies were amazing too."
MaryM,5,5,5,5,2021-05-23,What a wonderful evening! Everything was so impressive! Service was impeccable and food was incredibly delicious. Had such a special evening. Our party of five all agree it was the perfect choice for our celebration.
kbs84,5,5,5,5,2021-05-22,Had a fantastic evening celebrating an anniversary. Food was delicious and staff very attentive!
OpenTable Diner,3,4,1,4,2021-05-22,"Waited at least 45minutes for our glass of wine and didn’t get served our small salads for over an hour after we arrived. This was a lunch and we both had to be other places later in the day. Was extremely disappointed with how slow the service was and uncalled for to wait 45 minutes for a simple glass of wine.
Manager came over later and apologized and gave us gift card, but it was my friend’s birthday so was sad it wasn’t up to caliber"
SeattlePrincess,5,5,5,5,2021-05-22,Went for lunch service and food were fabulous but we were next to a large table of businessman so the noise was a little intense at times!
ElenaH,5,5,5,5,2021-05-20,"We were celebrating a birthday, the service was implacable, the food was delicious!!! When the hostess brought us to our table, there was a handwritten birthday card there! They also brought us a beautiful happy birthday decorated plate with a tiramisu cake and a candle! Love love love this place!!!"
KylaR,4,4,5,4,2021-05-18,I loved the bean and pasta soup. And the bread is outrageously  good. Excellent service.

michelleb,5,5,5,5,2021-05-12,We did not think it was right to add 20% auto gratuity  for our wine.We had a seperate check for wine and the  20%  after 20%  for food was a little steep.
TRsto,5,5,5,5,2021-05-11,Consistently great food and impeccable service!  Staff is very attentive and always a great experience.
Jfrom98006,5,5,5,5,2021-05-10,Excellent lunch menu and service. A bit pricey but worth it

ReneeB,5,5,5,5,2021-05-07,"The food was spectacular, and the wait staff made it that much better. The waiter knew the food extremely well, could explain with impressive comparisons, and was also very knowledgeable about the alcohol.  The timing of the food was excellent, too; it was nice to enjoy each course instead of feeling rushed when the next item arrives. It was delightful all around. We’ll definitely be back!"
Dennis,5,5,5,5,2021-05-07,"Thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Carmine’s! Loved the food, menu, drinks, service, ambiance. They totally nailed everything~ won’t hesitate to return as soon as possible! Thank you to our server Coco, who made it all just even more fabulous!"

Tifa,4,4,4,3,2021-05-04,"Had a little birthday lunch here today on their patio. Freshly rained so they had a lot of bugs out on the table. ( from the flowers / pillars) Minus that it was good. Service was a little slow,  food was great. Everything was tasty."
Seadiner59,5,5,5,5,2021-05-03,Great experience! Food was fantastic and we were able to sit outdoors on their covered heated patio. Service was wonderful. Will be back!
OpenTable Diner,3,3,5,4,2021-05-01,The duck was overcooked. Nothing too special about the food.
MosieSays,5,5,5,4,2021-04-30,"Italian food as it should be!  Authentic, quality ingredients.  Excellent wait staff.
It's a bit noisy at what seemed more than 50% occupancy.  We dined at 830pm so people started leaving and it quieted down towards the end of our meal.  It was our anniversary and they had a nice card at the table + comp'ed us a tiramisu to share - which was lovely."
Waddy,5,5,5,5,2021-04-30,"Carmine’s is our favorite restaurant!  The food, service and ambiance are wonderful!"

So many good dishes are offered it’s hard to make up your mind which one to order!  I ordered the special that day, wonderful risotto stuffed with crab.  It was awesome!  Their wine list is quite impressive.  I highly recommend dining at Carmine’s!"

KelliS,5,5,5,5,2021-04-22,"We went for our daughters 23rd Birthday and she was wished Happy Birthday from the hostess to the end of meal with a complimentary piece of cake given to her. The ambiance was nice, just a tad too loud that we couldn't hear each other talk some of the time, but it was overall excellent and would recommend to my friends and family! The staff was on top of it and the food was delicious."
CindyD,5,5,5,5,2021-04-22,"Delicious food, outstanding service. Pricey but worth it for special occasions and first meal out post vaccinations!"

MichaelG,5,5,5,5,2021-04-15,"Outstanding in every respect! Our server Luis was professional and personable. I asked for a modification to the menu and not only was it not a problem, but the final result was beyond my wildest dreams. I had heard from a friend that this was a great place. I actually felt that it had exceeded his praise. Carmine's is now on my favorites list"
delicious,5,5,5,4,2021-04-14,You have been going to Carmine’s downtown for years and enjoy having them in Bellevue now always dependable.
KariO,4,3,5,5,2021-04-14,Service was excellent. Great place to celebrate a special dinner.
TransplantedTexGal2,5,5,5,5,2021-04-13,"Spectacular lunch.  The service is always top notch, friendly and welcoming.  My husband had veal and I had fettuccine Alfredo.  Only comment was chicken was little nuggets of chicken sautéed instead of a breast grilled (which is what I requested).  Shrimp appetizer was delicious as well as minestrone soup and cauliflower soup.  No room for dessert."
nessiejo,4,4,4,4,2021-04-13,Always consistently lovely food and fabulous ambience.
Momof3,5,5,5,5,2021-04-09,I love the neighborhood vibe at Carmine’s. Such an amazing staff most of them have been there for years. The food is incredible! Beautiful restaurant highly recommend ❤️
WaGal,5,5,5,5,2021-04-09,Great crab risotto and sweetbreads.  Panna cotta was perfect and the bread was to die for.  We celebrated hubby’s birthday and he says that’s now his go to place for a special occasion (Move over Cafe Juanita!)

CoffeeMaven,5,5,5,5,2021-04-07,Excellent food and service. Tirimisu is to die for!
Friends,5,5,5,5,2021-04-06,Outstanding in every aspect! Felt very safe returning for the first time since COVID. Highly recommend!
MarkR,5,5,5,5,2021-04-02,"Noise level...perfect! Could have a great conversation with the people at your table and knowing that others were enjoying their conversation as well. The excitement for loud restaurants is over-rated and ridiculous...fine for a bar but not for a restaurant in which you wan to enjoy the time with the people you are there with. THIS is my favorite restaurant in all of the greater Seattle area. The perfect cocktail, perfect food...{Stanley Tucci would be envious if only he knew....shhh.}"
MaryB,2,4,3,2,2021-04-02,Carmines was packed on Thursday night when we went there for dinner.  It was if there weren't any Covid guidelines.  A large table of 15-18 young girls (9-10?) nearby took a lot of our waiter's attention and slowed down our service.
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2021-04-02,So happy Carmine's is open.  The service and food were great.
JimR,5,5,5,5,2021-04-02,"Excellent meal, awesome staff and restaurant. Highly recommend!"

When we arrived at our table, there was a cute anniversary card waiting for us and we also received a complimentary Tiramisu with 'happy anniversary' written. The server also had our food customised for our dietary preferences (vegetarian). I would definitely recommend this place for celebrating a special occasion."

love2bicycle,5,5,4,4,2021-02-27,"there's a good mix of Italian dishes: pasta and lamb, fish and steak. We always go for the spaghetti, the best you'll find in these parts, and have only tried the veal and salmon, both are very good, and prepared in interesting ways. The wait staff are attentive. the restaurant is beautiful and located across the street from the Bellevue city park,  and the view is very scenic. There's a poetic quality to the food and the place. Depending on the day, it's can be romantic, and yet it can be boisterous given the right mix of people."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-02-24,Came here for a birthday and it was great. Food was tasty and service was friendly.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2021-02-24,"We were so happy to find out lunch dine in is available again ! Food tasted even better than before! We had the fried calamari and sea bass special w garlic oil pasta! The calamari was tender and crispy and perfectly salted! Sea bass w puttanesca sauce was just perfect seasoned and pan fried. The pasta was the best one I’ve had considering I love the squid ink pasta they have on the menu. Plus Marian brought us a little dish of white truffle oil to go w pasta. IT WAS OUTSTANDING! We always enjoy the ambience of the restaurant and appreciates the fresh flowers displays. The services was attentive but not intruding . Food was prepared perfectly. That’s why we made it a weekly lunch at Carmine’s ! 
Thank you"

BruceL,5,5,5,5,2021-02-19,"It's not often that a restaurant can move or add a location and retain the same excellence as the original. Carmine's has done so with their Bellevue location. It is beautiful, the staff is wonderful and Carmine would be very proud. We will always have Carmine's at the top of our list."

Not only did they serve me an extraordinary meal but I had extraordinary service and really felt like I was the only person there.  This is by far the most elevated elite restaurant I’ve eaten at in a  long time and would and have recommended this to everyone for every occasion every time
Coby,5,5,5,5,2020-12-15,We thoroughly enjoyed dinner on your patio. One of the very few restaurants that has continued first class service and dining during the covid indoor closures.
MattyA,5,5,5,5,2020-12-13,"Amazing as always, never disappoints!
The best restaurant on the east side!"

David,4,5,4,4,2020-12-09,"My original post involved many problems that were seen during my first visit to Carmines; however, the issues we had are no longer going to be be a problem since the restaurant has rectified my complaints. They are also working with us to make it right. With limited options from the Governor's orders, they are doing the best they can. The food was very good and service was to be expected."
Adresser,5,5,5,5,2020-12-09,"Absolutely fabulous . Their doing everything they can to make dining outside fabulous. Service , food amazing

BigMeatNoWhammy,5,5,5,5,2020-11-15,"We love the place! Food and service always splendid. 

We went early hoping it would not be busy. However, not only was it busy but a 20 plus person bridal shower was going on. Further, the table next to us was not 6 feet away. We were uncomfortable and we will not return to their location until COVID is gone. Not sure I would eat outside given the relaxed attitude re Social Distancing. All that being said, we are glad we got a chance to go before the second shutdown."
DanaR,5,5,5,5,2020-11-15,We had an excellent dinner at Carmine with another couple on Saturday evening. The food and service were wonderful as always. One of our favorite places on the Eastside.
ScottC,5,5,5,5,2020-11-14,Carmine's did not follow COVID guidlines with regard to spacing or % occupancy.  I would not have gone had I known the management was ignorant of public safety and common sense.
Delightful,5,5,5,5,2020-11-14,"Lovely double date night - even with COVID Carmine's managed to make our night out an evening of fun and enjoyment.  The food was excellent.   Our waiter, Louis, was attentive and professional.  The restaurant was full but allowed for social distancing and safety - it felt like ""old times"" and a ""normal"" date.  Thanks Carmine's - we will be back as long as the Governor does not shut us down again?!?"

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-11-06,"My friend and I love coming here for lunch. It is quiet. It is calm and we like the food here. The decor is classy and I love the fresh flowers surrounding us. The fried calamari was  outstanding today! It’s not overly salted and overly cooked today and the presentation was beautiful. The scallop special today was delicious as well. Well balanced flavors of sea scallops, artichoke and bacon with pipping hot risotto was cooked perfectly. The pizza was awesome as well with nice chewy crispy crust and flavorful olive oil with fennel sausage. Lunch today was fabulous. Our server Marian was great as well. I love coming here however, today’s lunch was perfect in every way. We will be back next week 
Thank you"

DonicaB,5,5,5,5,2020-10-31,Beautiful interior. Pesto fettuccine with shrimp was so good!
Nickd,4,4,4,5,2020-10-31,"Our server was very good. Only complaint we had ... they did not remember we were celebrating a birthday. Not much point in asking if there's a special occasion when making the reservation if they're not going to acknowledge it.

The food was excellent. The risotto, rigatoni, and the beef short ribs were outstanding. All were good size portions that could be shared. 

The restaurant is very noisy, but lively and fun. Don't recommend if you're looking for a quiet setting. You can still have a conversation but there's lots of background noise to contend with. We were there on a busy Friday night."
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,4,2020-10-31,"It was an amazing dinner! Very good service, and we had a very nice waiter. Very good appetizers, and food! At the end they surprised us with an anniversary dessert!"

HLCW,5,5,5,5,2020-10-22,Such a fun night out with our family. Staff seemed to be very safe but it did not feel overly paranoid. Was nice to feel a bit like the olden day (pre March 2020).

RobB,5,5,5,5,2020-10-14,I’ve dined many times at Carmine’s both in Seattle and Bellevue. It is always fantastic and it is one of my long time person favorites.
CoffeeMaven,5,5,5,5,2020-10-14,"I had lunch with an old friend at Carmine’s where we enjoyed a fantastic meal.   Social distancing was the rule of the seating and the waiter wore a mask.  I ordered Linguine Alle Vongole which was comprised of fresh Manila clams, chilies, garlic, parsley and olive oil.  The linguini was perfectly al dente and the sauce was amazing.  I had to soak up the sauce with the amazing bread that was place on the table.  My friend ordered Spaghetti Ortolano with goat cheese, tomatoes, pine nuts, olive oil.  Again, the pasta was al dente and she loved the dish.  Carmine’s has become our favorite dining experience and we plan on going back soon for another delicious lunch (or dinner)."
AlinaS,5,5,5,5,2020-10-11,"This was an amazing place for a nice dinner! Our host was great, the food was amazing & it definitely made you feel warm on the inside. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!"
KevinF,5,4,5,5,2020-10-11,"We are frequent visitors to Carmine's in Bellevue.  Service is always very good, but this last visit it was spectacular.  Food is always very good - and this time was no different - thought the OssoBucco and filet was on point.  The duck was slightly overcooked - perhaps medium well, more than the ordered medium rare, but still very tasty.   One of our favorite places - we can rely on the staff at Carmine's always have a great product."
Chris,5,5,5,5,2020-10-11,Our server Carly was wonderful.!!! Answered our questions professionally and took good care of us. The food was excellent!

SteveM,5,5,5,4,2020-10-07,"Great food; the bolognese is actually a Ragu if that helps meat sauce people.  And the service was outstanding.  Lots of people at the restaurant, for good reason, but is COVID lax."

This,5,4,5,4,2020-09-17,"Lovely evening, service impeccable, food scrumptious! Plating could be improved, if you’re serving a small vs full course meal, the full course should fill up the plate and a garnish to make it more appealing would be appreciated, i.e., brown butter, sage gnocchi, maybe a sprig of sage should be included. Otherwise, it was wonderful and again, the food was amazing!"
DustinK,5,4,5,4,2020-09-16,Everything was great I would give it 5 stars all around. Only reason I gave it 4 in some areas is I wanted to make sure the 5 stars stands out for the service. The servers were outstanding!!

Aditya,4,5,2,2,2020-09-09,"Food was great: the soft calamari and dessert were the highlights. The pasta was good but not spectacular (only tried one). Service was very slow even though it wasn't busy (weekday night). We arrived at 8:10 and got our appetizers at 9:30, so we were a bit rushed to eat. 

Would go back for the desserts,"

Well spaced seating and a lovely outside patio area. Celebrating a special Anniversary and they had a few special touches.  Good wine selection, excellent food.  My pasta Vongole was perfect.  They made it with olive oil and garlic instead of marinara to order.  The risotto special was also perfect.  Overall such a great find!  We can’t wait to come back again!  Thanks for a great evening!  Highly recommend."

JennieD,5,5,5,5,2020-08-15,We had a wonderful night out and the food and service was outstanding.
BrienVD,5,5,5,5,2020-08-15,"Gosh, some of the best bolognese that I've ever eaten. This restaurant was fantastic. Not overly expensive, great ambience, and the food is amazing. Service was excellent as well! Very nice servers. I would 100% come back in a heartbeat. Just make sure you give yourself enough time for parking!! Valet took a bit due to rush hour on a Friday evening."
conniek,5,5,5,5,2020-08-13,Perfect in every way!
TodM,5,5,5,5,2020-08-12,One of the best restaurants I have been to in a very long time.  The service and food were outstanding.  This should be on your list.  I know I will be going back many times.
billieob,5,5,5,5,2020-08-11,Just  always a fabulous everything !!!
RAC2,5,5,5,5,2020-08-09,"This is our favorite restaurant to celebrate at. Phenomenal food, delightful service, and always a 5 star experience."
NatalieK,5,5,5,5,2020-08-08,"We have driven by Carmines several times and have been wanting to try it for a while now. We knew the food and atmosphere was going to be outstanding, but we always worry what the service will be like. Our waitress Coco was AMAZING, thank you for the awesome service and special night! We will be back many, many more times!!"
MPPPP,4,5,5,5,2020-08-07,I would give 5 out of 5 if it wasn't pandemic time. Everything was great except distance between tables weren't enough (6 feet).
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-08-05,"Carmine’s is the go to place for my wife and I to celebrate our special occasions.  We usually plan one to two occasions there a year.  We were a little worried that the pandemic would impact our experience, however just the opposite.  Both service and food quality were just as we remembered.  Carmine’s did a great job making our evening as fantastic in addition to keeping us safe!"
IshanA,5,5,5,5,2020-08-04,"Food and service was amazing, really enjoyed the friendly and inviting atmosphere. Best pasta and Chilean Sea Bass I’ve had in a long time!"
ArianE,5,5,5,5,2020-08-02,Great restaurant. Great food and wine list. They always nail steak and fish. Pricey. Service is top notch. Coco is awesome.
SHP112,5,5,5,5,2020-08-02,Love this place. I generally go once per month for lunch and sit at the bar for some veal parmigiana. Never disappoints. Good people watching.
Michelle,3,4,3,4,2020-08-02,"he waiter, who was in charge of our table, wearing a mask, but when he asked for an order, he coughed a few times, but neither apologized nor excused. It's not a big deal as usual, but I felt anxious and frustrated under the coronavirus pandemic. I want him to have good manners to provide food and drink."
Nomad46,1,1,3,1,2020-08-01,"Disappointed. Wait was over 30 mins from reservation. One of the dishes had to be sent back (rubbery chilean sea bass). Service from our waiter (sorry I can’t remember her name) save the night.  I understand everyone’s trying to get back on track, and am sure Carmine’s will, eventually."
WacGen,5,5,5,4,2020-07-31,Amazing food in downtown Bellevue with high class table service.
NativeNewYorker,5,5,5,5,2020-07-31,"The ONLY negative is the missing bar stools, and that is not their fault."
karanD,4,4,5,5,2020-07-31,"It is always a pleasure to eat there. Great staff, great food and 
always consistant"
HyejooJ,5,5,5,5,2020-07-28,"Overall everything was great!! Interior is beautiful, foods are delicious and perfect service!"
love2bicycle,5,5,5,5,2020-07-26,"the restaurant in Bellevue across the street from the city's main park is charming and very European looking. We sat at a secluded table with flowerbed brimming with beautiful plants on one side, and on the other, where we could see a lot of happy beautiful faces in the background, very sweet! Service was impeccable and the food divine. My husband loved his spaghetti --which is high praise  from a man who loves his pasta, and had the proverbial Italian mother who knew how to cook the old fashioned  way. My veal scallopini was everything I could wish for, tender and flavorful, simply amazing! And the prices were very reasonable, another plus!"
ScottW,5,5,5,5,2020-07-26,Fantastic to get back to Carmine’s. All staff was amazing and health protocols were filled to a T. Food was exceptional
michul,5,5,4,5,2020-07-26,This place remains one of our very favorite places!  Order the eggplant it’s amazing.....
ArtemK,5,5,5,5,2020-07-25,"Food was very good and so was the service! Portions were fantastic and we were full from an appetizer, pasta dish, and a steak dish for 2. Everything was very well prepared. We had the mozzarella and tomato basil appetizer, squid ink pasta with mussels and clams, and the Madagascar steak with risotto. We spent just over 100$ but it was well worth it for the occasion we had. Great experience overall!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-07-19,"Great food, amazing service. Will definitely come back"
davomaso,5,5,5,5,2020-07-19,"The service and ambiance is the best in Bellevue and maybe all Puget Sound.  Go to enjoy the food, wine and being alive!"
KristinJ,5,5,5,5,2020-07-19,"I love Carmine's for their food, their service, and the quality of dining experience they provide."
Rjspancake,5,5,5,4,2020-07-19,Carmine's is always first rate - one of the things I like about it is they give me complete confidence that we will be taken care of - and we are.   I gave the ambiance 4 stars as it was a bit disconcerting that a % of guests were coming in without masks.  I'm not sure what their policy is but I know what mine is!
FoodPassionista,3,5,2,3,2020-07-17,"The service tonight was sub par. Not the typical Carmine’s experience.  Also, I didn’t like the increased number of people and lack of social distancing.  They have lowered the bar."
michaelm,5,5,5,4,2020-07-15,"lovely place for a nice dinner.
pricey , but very good food ."
Isabella,5,5,5,5,2020-07-14,"Amazing restaurant, would highly recommend. Delicious food, kind staff. Absolutely beautiful view of park at sunset."
casinojoe,5,5,5,5,2020-07-12,"What an amazing restaurant. Also very clean,  everyone was wearing a mask and staff had face shields.  The atmosphere was wonderful with the windows open and great views of the park.  The food was perfect and tasted fresh, local and homemade.  We will be back for sure.  The staff was so friendly.  I love that they validate parking as well because that's at least 30 dollars."
OpenTable Diner,4,5,5,4,2020-07-11,Not as much social distancing as I would have expected. Have been to other restaurants and seen more.
TiffanyM,5,5,5,5,2020-07-10,"Carmines never disappoints. Everything was perfect, right down to the firmness of the pasta. By far, my favorite go-to when I want to feel pampered."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-07-09,We had an amazing anniversary at Carmines!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-07-08,Very Italian feeling! We loved spending our anniversary.

KATHLEENM,5,5,5,4,2020-07-03,"It is my go to restaurant for a special occasion. Way too expensive for a basic outing. That being said, great food, excellent service, nice space, and you don’t leave hungry."
AndyS,5,5,5,5,2020-07-01,The service and food were excellent.
georgeg,5,4,5,5,2020-07-01,one of our favorites 👏
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-07-01,Food and service was excellent as always! Enjoyed spending my birthday dinner there!
EthanS,5,5,5,5,2020-06-30,"I had a fantastic time here with my date. Out server was fantastic, funny, and easy to talk to. He had amazing timing, bringing out our dishes at great intervals. The food was some of the best I'd had, and I definitely can't wait to come back."
TeachableMoments,5,5,4,5,2020-06-28,Consistently delicious and great atmosphere. Servers wore shields and tables seemed more distanced.  It was a great first experience out to dinner since the opening of  in-dining restaurants.
ChrisT,5,5,5,5,2020-06-27,Incredible experience from start to finish. Love this restaurant
Paul,5,5,5,5,2020-06-27,Loved it per usual! Awesome experience as always. Best pastas ever
LindsayA,5,5,5,5,2020-06-27,You can’t do better than Carmine’s for an authentic Italian meal & a superior experience.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2020-06-26,"Birthday 

Great job despite the challenges of COVID-19!"
STELLA,5,5,4,5,2020-06-26,Very lovely being back at carmines with it’s wonderful cuisine
OpenTable Diner,5,4,5,4,2020-06-26,Tonight was the first time dining in a restaurant in 3 months!! Fine experience!
FaithinBellevue,5,5,5,5,2020-06-24,"What a great experience for my first meal out in Bellevue since COVID-19 hit. The food and cocktails were nothing short of amazing. Our waiter, Kellen (I think this was how to spell his name.), was friendly and well educated on the menu and cocktails and was able to offer recommendations. The restaurant has taken the proper precautions to protect their staff and the patrons from COVID-19. All employees were wearing masks and face shields. Tables were spaced out appropriately. Love this place and will be going back."
NativeNewYorker,5,5,5,5,2020-06-24,Sooooooo happy the best restaurant in Bellevue is open again!  Only thing  missing are the barstools.  Eagerly awaiting their return. Then all will be right with the world.
Lucy,5,5,5,5,2020-06-23,Wonderful meal. Dessert not as good. We like the location.
ChristianM,2,3,1,2,2020-06-23,"Servers were all watching the young 20somethings and were rude to us. The man who brought our fish insisted it was halibut when I had special ordered sea bass. “Interesting evening,” there are other restaurants that give such better service. Not sure we will show here for awhile. Tired of the snobbery"
Armani,5,5,5,5,2020-06-21,"outstanding service, food & service.  Great for business, casual or family events.  Fantastic menu choices.  Staff is friendly, professional and knowledgeable."
BeatriceS,4,4,4,4,2020-06-21,"Service was great - I did feel that there was not enough space between each table - menu are not being disposed- the hostess grabbed a menu from another table ( guest ) rather concerning 
Food was warm upon arrival - somewhat salty ( veal)"
AmyGourmetdoneskinny,5,5,5,5,2020-06-21,"We love this place. Great food, great wine, great staff and the ambience is wonderful!"
GaryS,5,5,5,5,2020-06-21,Always great food and terrific service. We sat on the patio last night and the noise level was much lower and easy to hear. It was lovely.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-06-21,We love this place
DDiner,4,5,5,4,2020-06-20,Not enough space between some indoor tables!
PaulL,5,5,5,5,2020-06-20,So glad to have Carmine's open. Always great and warm service with great food. Need to order dessert first: Always too full to try after dinner.
MTTB,4,4,4,5,2020-06-19,"Food was good, but didn’t have anything that was out of this world amazing. We had fried calamari and Kushi oysters for appetizers. Good - nothing fantastic. My husband had the venison ravioli and I had the veal cannelloni for our entree. They were good but not memorable. His ravioli was better. 4/5 for food. 

Server was super nice. Although, it took really long to get our orders taken and to get our entree, overall, the experience was nice. 4/5 for service. 

Nice place. I’d come back for happy hour if I was in the area. Do they even have happy hour specials though?"
MikeS,5,5,5,5,2020-06-18,"Amazing service, food and attention to details.  Shaken not stirred..."
MichaelK,5,5,5,5,2020-06-18,"Another perfect meal at Carmine's!  Had the special of the day, a Saffron Risotto topped by perfectly seared, exquisitely fresh Jumbo Scallops.  Attentive, friendly, energetic service.  Love the outdoor patio."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-06-18,Loved the note acknowledging our anniversary
Gman,5,5,5,4,2020-06-17,Our first meal out since restaurants were closed due to COVID.  Very attentive service and the food quality was outstanding.  Many people enjoyed outside seating which offers am active view of the park in downtown Bellevue.  If you are a seafood lover the Cioppino  Northwest is a must have.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-06-16,Enjoyed our time
KimB,5,5,5,5,2020-06-16,Our waiter Kalen (sp?) was incredible! They were so accommodating and I had an incredible 5 star bday experience with my family. Thank you!!
Dineout4fun,5,5,5,5,2020-06-13,"Amazing food, amazing service!  The Carmine’s team never disappoints.  Great job and thanks for the great dining experience."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-03-15,I absolutely love this restaurant
KathyJ,5,5,5,5,2020-03-15,"Carmines is one of those restaurants that you know will always deliver.  Impeccable service, outstanding food-no other place I'd rather go to for great Italian food-even better than places we've been to in Boston's North End."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-03-14,Super good food and good service
John,5,5,5,5,2020-03-12,Great food and service
TreaR,4,5,3,5,2020-03-08,"We like entertaining guests over dinner at Carmine’s, but only if we can have a four-top in the bar. So, when I made early 5pm reservations on Open Table, I wrote “In the bar, please!”  I got the two normal confirmation texts/emails.  And, as requested, we were seated in the bar.  We ordered cocktails, appetizers, wine, salads, and our main courses. Then, at around 7 pm, when our waiter delivered our dessert/after-dinner-drink menus, he apologized saying the hostess had promised our table to another group and they had been waiting for a half hour.  So we would need to be moved up to the bar stools.  With four of us, that made it all weird; so we and our guests just decided to give our waiter a great tip and leave.  On the way out, I asked what happened and the manager said we had made our bar-table request on Open Table and the others had “called it in,” so they had priority.  He offered us a gift certificate but we really didn’t want it. At this point, I’m not sure whether we will go back to Carmine’s despite their great food."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-03-05,Best Italian cuisine and dining experience in all of Seattle/Bellevue. Perfectly executed atmosphere and beyond amazing food. Highly recommended.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-03-05,Great food!
Missy,5,5,5,5,2020-03-03,"Awesome dinner,  excellent service, friendly atmosphere.....could not ask for more!"
JanA,5,4,5,4,2020-03-01,The food was excellent.  The ;portions are very good.  Our table was ready right on time and we never felt rushed.  I will definitely recommend Carmines to our friends.  A drive star restaurant in every way.
choosiefoodie,5,5,5,5,2020-02-29,"Great food, and absolutely impeccable, attentive service.  It made for a lovely evening out with friends.

It's a big menu, with lots of fish/meat options, and not so many veg options.  But the server was very helpful to make suggestions for a substantial vegetarian meal, and accommodate any dietary preferences including substituting gluten free pasta, if needed."
DIANEN,5,5,5,4,2020-02-28,Carmine's never disappoints.  The service and food are always wonderful.  The noise level is pretty high so don't expect quiet conversation.
DonZ,5,5,5,5,2020-02-27,"Great people there, first time and enjoyed the atmosphere."
Furgus,5,5,5,5,2020-02-27,"The service was beyond reproach, friendly, helpful without overbearing.  The wait between courses was a bit long.  Will definitely be back."
JoelG,4,5,4,4,2020-02-26,Carmine's is always one of the best options in Bellevue.
Chewie,5,5,5,5,2020-02-25,"Beautiful decor, impeccable service, and excellent food!  What more could you ask for?  Definitely a top choice for anyone looking for a fine dining choice in Bellevue."
DougS,5,5,5,5,2020-02-25,Our food and ambiance was outstanding!  Everything about the Bellevue location reminded us of the Seattle we so love.  Thank you for providing a wonderful dining experience!
Returncustomer,4,5,5,4,2020-02-25,"Great atmosphere, food and service! I'm a repeat customer because the service and food are always good and on point."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-02-22,I always love Carmine’s! The dining room is very noisy though which is why I prefer the lounge.
Cliffy,5,5,5,5,2020-02-22,Excellent Food & Service as always!
TobyR,5,5,5,5,2020-02-22,Carmine’s is legit! Great family restaurant in best part of Bellevue.
goldvodka,5,5,5,5,2020-02-21,Food was super delicious but the restaurant is always packed. Would come here more than 2 times per week.
K9momof2,5,5,5,5,2020-02-18,Ossobucco and Venison ravioli were out of this world!  Bread was so good!!!!  Noise level in main dining was a bit much but when I asked they moved us to a lovely quiet table in the lounge.  You simply must go!!
EileenC,4,4,5,5,2020-02-18,"Didn’t know that BELLEVUE had such a gem tucked away. Beautiful restaurant with great service and delicious food. Only hiccup was that we choose one of the special entrees, the sea bass and were shocked at the $45 price tag. Very expensive lunch. I guess it’s tricky to rattle off the specials without mentioning prices. Seems a bit tacky to do so but then again, getting charged so much for one dish unexpectedly is a hit."
dmaui,5,5,5,5,2020-02-15,"My husband and I tried it out on Valentine's Day and it was fabulous.  The food was excellent.  The service was impeccable.  We were tucked away in a corner so the noise level was low too. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try, I can't wait to go back!"
Bird,5,4,5,5,2020-02-15,Lovely. Reminds me of the charm of the Seattle restaurant. Tonight's tiramisu was the best and so was the fried calamari!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-02-15,"Absolutely wonderful--can't wait to go back!  The food is magnificent, and the service is great."
OsmanS,4,4,5,5,2020-02-15,Beautiful setting and ambiance. Pretty upscale dining experience.  The prices are in the higher end.   Our server is very attentive. Overall a great experience.
Teedub,5,5,5,5,2020-02-15,"Excited to go back soon. Delicious food, I’m pretty picky about Italian but it was superb. Great atmosphere and service."
Dob71,2,2,3,4,2020-02-14,"Carmine’s has been my go to restaurant for lunches, date night and girls night out from its opening.  It’s a beautiful restaurant and the service a usually ok. Unfortunately, over the past couple years with the increase of the number of guest dinning the quality of the food has suffered. You can expect for the fish to be over cooked and the beautiful squid ink past to be almost the texture of mashed potatoes. The Risotto looks and taste like a big glob of overCooked rice. So disappointed, thankfully Bellevue has new restaurants popping up everyday."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-02-14,The service and the food were at the top end of amazing. We will be back!
EdwardD,5,5,5,5,2020-02-14,Best dining experience in Bellevue!
LindaC,5,5,5,5,2020-02-13,"Always wonderful to eat at Carmine's Bellevue as well as Flagship Restaurant Il Terrazzo Carmine in Pioneer Square, Seattle.   Carmine's Bellevue is located just south of the Bellevue Park and looks out onto the Park with all the trees, and gentle slopes.  Service, menu choices and fine china make this the perfect spot.  This is no fast  casual place!  I will eat here again."
AdrianR,5,5,5,5,2020-02-12,"Wonderful servers and excellent food!
The Adrian’s List of wines has great selections!"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-02-12,"Great food, service, and overall experience!"
MaliniP,4,5,2,4,2020-02-12,"The food took to long to be served.  I was extremely underwhelmed by the service.  I expected better.  It took over an hour after we arrived for our order to be taken and food to arrive. For lunch, that is too long."
OpenTable Diner,4,5,4,4,2020-02-11,Food took a little it was busy so understandable but the food was so very much worth the wait.  I recommend three herb crusted rack of lamb.
BenE,3,3,3,2,2020-02-09,"First time visiting Carmine's and have heard nothing but good things. Overall the experience was good, not great. Unfortunately the restaurant was VERY loud. Of course we expected this going in on a busy Saturday night but as a group of 4 we found it very hard to hold conversation as we all had to keep leaning into the table to hear each other. It also made it challenging to order and interact with the servers. This can't really be controlled by the restaurant but perhaps there are additional ways they could look to improve the acoustics in the space? Not really sure. My only other issue was the steak I had was over-seasoned and came out extremely salty. I powered through it because I generally like salty foods but even this was over the top for me so I only ate about half of it. The rest of the food I had, and my friends had, was fantastic. Probably was just a one time miss I am guessing. I would recommend others to go to Carmine's and I will give it another shot for sure."
IgorD,5,5,5,5,2020-02-08,Everything was perfect 👌🏽
RobertR,5,5,5,5,2020-02-06,Absolutely fantastic experience
Dawg,3,4,2,3,2020-02-06,"Placed a reservation for the 2 of us for our 20th anniversary lunch.  We were seated in the bar facing the tv.  Bar had a few tables and the server was the bartender.   There were several restaurant vendors in the bar working on menus and obviously getting the attention of the staff.  Food was good, service was okay, and lacked the ambiance of the Seattle location."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-02-05,Birthdays w friends. The food and drinks were delicious and the service was great. It was a wonderful evening. We all agreed that we will be returning.
RandP,5,5,5,5,2020-02-05,"Great food, impeccable service...never disappoints!"
RescueDogsRock,3,3,4,2,2020-02-04,"We were celebrating my husband’s birthday and had indicated this on our reservation. We were seated next to a family with two very small kids. One child would crawl across his Mom on the bench seat that my husband was seated on. The kid was trying to get our attention and was crawling very close to our table and to my husband. Like within a few inches as table spacing was tight. Really distracting, frustrating and frankly not what I expect or hope for in a higher end dining experience. Food was ok. My pork was really dry. They quickly offered to redo it so the server tried hard. Nonetheless I left feeling like I way overpaid given the very poor ambiance and the food quality. Disappointed."
tapr,4,5,5,4,2020-02-02,"Highest quality food I have had in any restaurant.  I have traveled all of Europe, Caribbean  and most of the US.  Staff willing to ensure our visit was as expected."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-02-01,Had a great time celebrating birthdays and getting family together! Wonderful evening!!!
CynthiaE,5,5,5,4,2020-02-01,Staff is fabulous! i would recommend for special occasion
ChrisJ,4,4,5,5,2020-02-01,"It was very enjoyable. I have been here many times and I like it very much. I can’t go five stars because there are Italian places I enjoy more but you cannot go wrong. Excellent service, great quiet environment, and it is very comfortable. The cannelloni is very good."
LindaC,5,5,5,5,2020-02-01,"This was the first time at Carmine's Bellevue.  I have dined in their flagship restaurant Il Terrazzo Carmine in Pioneer Square, Seattle many times.  Carmine's Bellevue is absolutely beautiful looking out onto the Bellevue City Park, a 21-acre oasis of green in the heart of Bellevue so the view is beautiful and restful.  The menu is typically Italian and well crafted.  They have valet parking to make it a treat to visit at any time."
Rosie,3,2,4,4,2020-01-28,"The salad I ordered was almost all cheese and no dressing. Very blah. Not much take and chicken was dry. Cauliflower soup was very good, but very rich."
AndrewS,4,5,5,3,2020-01-26,There was a large group of loud and seemingly drunk people behind us which took away from the date night we were trying to have. Otherwise it was an excellent experience with amazing food and wine.
bmoreseattle,5,5,5,5,2020-01-24,"Food was amazing.  Highly recommend the bruschetta trio.  My friend and I both sound not stop raving about the bread; I do not know if it is made in house or not, but the bread was fresh and flavorful.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pesto and prawn fettuccini.  It struck the perfect balance--flavorful but not too salty, creamy but not heavy.  She enjoyed her cannelloni, which she said tasted authentic.  We were so stuffed that we did not make it to dessert.  However, we already decided halfway through our meal that we would have to go back with our family and friends.  We were celebrating her birthday.  The restaurant was fancier than expected, so I could see it being perfect for special occasions.  It is also spacious.  We went for lunch, so it was relatively quiet.  However, I imagine that it could get loud if the restaurant was full of diners.  Friendly and professional service.  Highly recommend the restaurant.  Cannot wait to go back."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-01-04,The best food and service! We had a great time
Katella77,5,5,5,5,2020-01-03,Great service and food.  Love the decor.  You will not be disappointed.
AdamW,5,5,5,5,2020-01-03,I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Carmine's as usual. The waitstaff is professional and knowledgeable and will go the extra to ensure the customer experience is phenomenal.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2020-01-03,"Back again for a family dinner before kids headed out of town. Wonderful evening, as usual."
kenp,3,3,4,4,2020-01-01,"Maybe because it was New Year's eve the food was pre-prepared? The food that came out was not piping hot and looked like it was sitting for awhile. In particular the Eggplant Parm which is usually excellent. The Linguine with Clams had lots of broken shells and grit. Quite disappointed in what is typically a very good dish.
It is a very nice place and will look at this last visit as an out liar."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-12-29,"We love it here ! 
We had 5pm reservation and we were running late bc we were still watching our play in Issaquah. Called to have it moved to 5:30. They were really accommodating. Good thing we made it before 5:30. 
And the most pleasant surprise was our waiter Brad from previous visit is serving us again! Yay! 
Our orders were delicious. Even gluten free pasta had texture and not mushy. My ossobuco was very flavorful and the bone marrow was fantastic! Alfredo small portion was a lot! Not complaining. 
Even the bread with crispy crust and chewy center leaves a lot of flavor in my palate. 
Brad was kind to chase us down the garage and return the credit card we left on the table. Saddest part was we left behind our leftovers😩
Overall it’s a great place to be in. It’s classy and not pretentious. Love the genuine people working in. 
Thanks again Brad for the great service
Will be back"
FinanM,5,5,5,5,2019-12-28,"My husband and I truly love Carmine’s. They have the best customer service, food and ambience. Must try if you’re in the Seattle/Bellevue area. Cannot get enough of their pasta. ❤️"
RachlS,4,5,3,4,2019-12-20,"We love Carmines and go often, however, the service this time was average at best. Our courses were spaced too far apart and we were sitting waiting for our mains for about 20minutes. My guess is they were over staffed. will update the review next time we go! We still love it!"
sounder,4,5,5,3,2019-12-19,Much noisier than their Seattle restaurant.  Our location smelled fishy whenever they cooked Sea Bass.  Food and service were outstanding.  Next time I will return to their Seattle restaurant.
JayM,5,5,5,4,2019-12-19,"Food and service were excellent.  The noise level was very high, mostly because they were very busy."
SamanthaW,5,5,5,5,2019-12-19,"Love Carmines, simply the best in Bellevue and Seattle"
TomB,3,3,5,3,2019-12-19,"We had reservations for two.  At first we were sat at a table in the middle of the floor right next to wait staff station who stood over us and were constantly whizzing by.  Not very good.  We asked to be reseated which they did right away.  That was great.  Our server, Katya, was excellent.  We felt the food was ok, but not spectacular.  Wines were overpriced.  All in all, it was ok, but not sure if we would return.  Maybe we'll give it another try after the holidays."
MikeB,5,5,5,5,2019-12-18,Terrific food and great service

NatalieS,5,5,5,5,2019-12-14,"Carmine’s remains the gold standard for fine Italian dining. Impeccable service, lovely ambiance, mouth-watering dishes. The veal never disappoints. The ravioli with wild mushrooms was a delight. Wonderful service with warmth. A perfect restaurant for any occasion."
JanniT,5,5,5,5,2019-12-13,"Beautiful restaurant, consistently wonderful food, excellent service."
ScotK,4,4,4,4,2019-12-13,"The food was excellent.  I ordered the veal scallopine and was prepared excellently.  

Our server was great. Efficient and not hovering constantly."
ChelseaC,5,5,5,4,2019-12-12,"Phenomenal food and service. We were a little rushed for time and they worked with us to get food and bill in a timely fashion, otherwise I imagine we would have been welcomed to linger. Sweetly decorated for the holidays."
dmw1,4,3,5,3,2019-12-10,"We’ve very much enjoyed Carmines on previous occasions, but this time were a bit disappointed with the food. The soup of the day (cream of asparagus) was bland and the texture uneven.  My wife’s cannelloni was disappointing as was my fettuccine with prawns.  On the positive side, the bread and spumoni were excellent and the service outstanding; all service people were unobtrusive but very attentive to our needs without being asked."
BobK,5,5,5,5,2019-12-10,Best restaurant in Bellevue!
Custis,5,4,5,5,2019-12-08,"We attending with two young girls, ages 5 & 8.  Maybe only ones with young kids.  The service was outstanding.  Our server was good with recommendations.  All of us enjoyed some type of pasta and all was good.  Lobster bisque and calamari were tasty.  This is our third time to enjoy Carmine's and will definitely return.  It was nice to get a complement from the hostess about the behavior of our young ladies.  Appreciative."

lovetoeat,5,5,3,5,2019-12-03,"Paolo is snobby, dry and slow. His assistant Roberto is perfect. This is the second time I got below average service from Paolo and probably the last time. I will either request different server or go only to Il terrazzo"

luv2eat,5,5,5,5,2019-11-21,We had a birthday lunch celebration and everything was perfect! I requested a round table which we got and we were so lucky that the restaurant wasn’t too busy so the noise level was perfectly fine. Our waiter was delightful and got everything that we requested. Great experience!
GalaxyRisky,5,5,5,5,2019-11-20,"Just a little ""oops"".  I requested a quiet table...then, within 15 minutes a huge party of 20 were sat right next to us!  Not quiet!  So we moved tables. The hostess could have done better!"
Lucy21,5,5,5,5,2019-11-20,Carmine’s never disappoints. The food is very good and nicely presented. The service is the best in Bellevue. And the reasonably priced valet service is a plus. I look forward to my next visit.
KC75,5,5,5,5,2019-11-19,friend in town from LA. she loved the food and thought it was beautiful.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-11-19,Il Terrazzo Carmines Has been my favorite restaurant since I was a child and my parents loved it to go for special occasions. Carmine’s is every bit as good and a favorite spot for my husband and I to celebrate anything and everything from a mundane day to a birthday to an anniversary…
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-11-19,Superior food and service
OpenTable Diner,2,3,2,3,2019-11-17,Parking directions were unclear. Tables too close together. Food was not that great.
Jaskk,5,5,5,5,2019-11-15,Delicious food.
brunchbunch,2,2,2,1,2019-11-15,"Service was not impressive, they know how many guests they will have and the wait staff were rushing around in a stupid frenzy. Not the best atmosphere for a special dinner out. It felt like a very busy night which they should have been prepared for."
DebP,5,5,5,5,2019-11-14,Very nice evening with in a quiet corner

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-11-08,Lunch during the week was nice and quiet
AprilE,5,5,5,5,2019-11-06,Came here for a friends birthday day and was very happy with the service. When we arrived they'd gone out of their way to leave a note for her on the table that said Happy Birthday and everything. Waitress was extremely helpful in selecting out drinks and food. Only real note was that it did take a while for the food to arrive to the table but we were given bread to hold off and enjoyed the atmosphere so it wasn't really a bother.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-11-03,Wedding celebration
DaniT,5,5,5,5,2019-11-02,"The food was INCREDIBLE and the service was phenomenal!! They made my birthday and anniversary fantastic and so special!! Definitely a fun place for special celebrations, I saw some people there causally as well"
MaxK,5,5,5,5,2019-11-02,"Every experience at Carmine’s is special and delightful. It’s been my favorite restaurant in Bellevue for a while now and for good reason. The ambiance is posh, food is delicious, and the service is really special. This time around I tried a few different items on the menu. For appetizers I strongly suggest the eggplant parmesan! The beef tartare was also quite delicious! For main courses the osso buco, duck breast, halibut, fileto con gnocchi, and ribeye are my personal favorites! I asked for my ribeye to be medium-rare and it came out perfectly! It melted in my mouth. If you are a fan of osso buco this is the best osso buco I’ve ever had. The halibut is soft and flaky! For dessert they have the best spumoni ice cream, tiramisu, semifreddo, and profiteroles. I tried the profiteroles for the first time yesterday and I was blown away. They have this rich melted chocolate on top of them and they looked gorgeous. For Washington wine I suggest the quilceda creek, Cayuse, or D2. For Italian wine I really liked the Vigorello. I’m terms of white French white wine I was really impressed with the christophe pichon condrieu. They also have a Vueve Rose which is delicious! The manager Adrian really works hard to make sure we felt special during our reservation. Everything was perfect per usual and I can’t wait to come back!"
ToddJ,5,5,5,5,2019-10-29,"Great food,exceptional service.

Aubern,5,5,5,5,2019-10-20,"Superb! Everything was spectacular, from food, service, ambiance. The restaurant was recommended by a friend and we are so glad we took her up on the recommendation."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-10-20,"It was GREAT! Made reservation from open table. Requested a quiet table for birthday dinner. We arrived at table was a birthday card welcoming us. Wait staff showed at our table right away. Our ordering experience was swift and dinners served in a timely manner and all foods were popping hot. 
We both enjoyed the halibut and veal scallopini. We ordered extra gluten free pasta and squid ink pasta. It was all delicious and flavorful. Oh! The bread was awesome ! Crispy crust and chewy flavorful texture. Best bread EVER! 
Brett was a very great waiter that served us. He was pleasant, patient and humerous. Our overall experience at Carmine’s was WAYYYYYYY better than Ascend Prime steak. It felt genuine at Carmine’s. Interior is classy as well as the patio going into the restaurant. It’s well kept and clean. We will return"
pickyeater,4,4,4,3,2019-10-19,"LOVE Carmine’s. This night, the restaurant was packed and we were seated next to a very large"

datenightdiner,3,3,2,2,2019-10-10,This is a big noisy restaurant. I just got back from Italy and the food at Carmine’s does not compare
aierfalomn,5,5,5,5,2019-10-10,"First time visit, very competent staff & chef, lots of gluten-free options. No bad dishes, always a good sign. Halibut special was amazing. Even the panna-cotta was excellent. Relaxed ambience. Will be back!"
PattiF,5,5,5,5,2019-10-10,"Celebrating a big birthday was treated as a very special occasion, and we loved it!  The complimentary dessert was amazing!"
Kathy,5,5,5,4,2019-10-09,"I took a friend to Carmine's for her birthday and there was a little birthday note on the table when we arrived, and they brought out a chocolate mousse with a chocolate ""Happy Birthday"" drizzle on the plate - so very thoughtful and appreciated!  We both ordered a side caesar salad and never wanted it to end - so good!!  She had the halibut special and I had gnocchi with brown butter - she loved her halibut and my gnocchi was fluffy and so delicious.  Oh, and I wanted to eat the entire basket of bread...just enough crust on the outside and softness on the inside.  Carmine's isn't cheap but not prohibitively expensive either - just a wonderful place for a celebration or any time you want a delicious meal in a beautiful atmosphere."
CB333,5,5,5,5,2019-10-06,Wonderful food and service. I have been here several times and never disappoints.
dmw1,4,5,5,2,2019-10-06,"Superior food, attentive and cordial service on a busy Saturday night.  Room is very, very noisy and, as I am hard of hearing, I was fortunate to have my wife with me to maintain a conversation with our guest."
CatherineB,3,3,4,4,2019-10-06,"Although I enjoyed the service and ambiance very much, the food was somewhat disappointing for such an upscale Italian restaurant. House bread was flavourful and fresh. The Burrata was excellent. The Insalata di Mista was ridiculously overpriced and not remarkable in the least. Lettuce with vinegar for $18? Should have been $9.  I also wasn't overly impressed with my gnocchi. It was bland and a very mushy. One of my friends had the veal and said it was also not at all at the level that she expected. My third friend LOVED her Rigatoni Bolognese.  That's why the mostly 3 stars. I love Italian food and have been to Italy 4 times, so maybe my bar is too high.

I would like to give it another try, especially as it's a great looking place with awesome waiters, but unless I am back in Bellevue for some reason I would probably look elsewhere."
Naylam,5,5,5,5,2019-10-06,"love the amazing experience and great food!

stu2you,5,5,5,5,2019-09-27,We went to Carmine's for my birthday. The staff greeted us warmly as we walked in. Our waiter was unusually friendly and told us about the evening's specials. My wife and I ordered the cream of asparagus soup and the petrale sole both of which were excellent. The waiter brought my dessert with a candle in it. The service was outstanding and the noise level was fairly low for the size of the restaurant. Everybody had a wonderful time.
SheilaG,5,5,5,5,2019-09-26,"Always a perfect meal. Excellent service, lovely setting, delicious ingredients and preparation. So happy you are in bellevue!"

kathrynR,5,5,5,5,2019-09-22,Always love Carmines.  Service is great and the food choices are wonderful.  Thank you as always
Operafans,3,2,3,3,2019-09-22,"Prices here are high even for Bellevue's trendy spenders.  The menu items read and sound wonderful, but what comes to the table leaves much to be desired.  The risotto special, for example, was asparagus tips, roasted red peppers, topped with a lobster tail.  The peppers, far from roasted, were just softened as they cooked in the final stages of finishing the risotto and gave it a bitter, harsh taste.  A scavenger hunt turned up not a single asparagus tip; the rice had a greenish hue so perhaps it sat near an asparagus.   At some point.  The lobster tail shell was atop the risotto and the tail pulled out.  They might as well have left it in the shell: it was tough, dry, and tasteless.  

We alerted our server who in turn, he said, alerted the chef.  The response: a scoop of sorbet - and I promise this is what he said - ""to get the taste of the risotto out of our mouth.""  Guess they don't care about customers but see them as disposable, replaceable items.

Why this place is jammed to overflowing is beyond me.  When it first opened, we had a nice but not astonishing dinner yet thought it was romantic enough to return for an anniversary.  With exceptions, of course, Bellevue seems to have no end to flashy, high priced eateries where food comes in a distant third or fourth to décor, being seen, and even more absurdly priced cocktails.  Carmine's fits right in that mold.

If you want romantic, great food, and expensive, there are several eateries way more worth it.  Back to Café Juanita or perhaps Canlis next year."
JBDJ,4,4,5,3,2019-09-22,"The food, and service excellent. But too noisy to carry on a conversation (amongst 4 people). 
Would either go very early in the evening when it is less crowded or late in the evening to avoid the noise."
OpenTable Diner,2,3,3,4,2019-09-22,"Food was very good, but it didn't come as listed. Photo below of steak that was supposed to come with asparagus and risotto. We didn't realize what we missed until we had already walked out."
Foodie,5,5,5,5,2019-09-22,"Excellent service, food quality, and attention to detail! We were celebrating my friend’s birthday, and the Carmine’s staff had written a birthday card, delivered a delicious dessert with a lit candle, and even offered to take our picture together!"
MaryD,4,4,3,4,2019-09-21,Food was good but seemed over-priced and the service was slow.
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2019-09-18,"Roberto was very good.  I think he would like to be a full time waiter.
Food was awesome."

pickyeater,4,4,5,5,2019-09-17,"Love, love, love Carmines. Tonight we had the ossobuco and halibut. Amazing- across the board. And the service is the best. Warm, friendly and outstanding."
HuskyHans,4,5,5,3,2019-09-15,I had been to the Carmines Downtown on several occasions and this was simply the same except in Bellevue.  As usual the food and service were outstanding.  The only issue we had were some fruit flies that hung around our table.  Not many but enough to be a little distracting.  They like my wife seemed particularly interested in the nice Cabernet she was having.
RitaD,5,5,5,5,2019-09-14,This is my favorite Italian restaurant.  The food is amazing & the service is outstanding.  We always bring family here when they visit.  It’s got a great atmosphere & vibe.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-09-14,Lovely atmosphere. Great place for a special dinner. The food was delicious and the service was great. Definitely will come back in the future!
MCafiero,4,5,5,4,2019-09-14,"My husband and I selected Carmine’s (or is it Carmines?) to celebrate our anniversary, and it was such a memorable visit. From a hand-written anniversary card on our table, to a complimentary anniversary dessert delivered to us to cap off the meal, we felt appreciated and cared for from the start of our evening to the end of it.

Service was lovely; our server Jennifer was warm and had a great sense of humor (she seemed a little new or nervous, perhaps?). She brought us a taste of their house wine made especially for them by Betz Winery, and while it wasn’t the flavor profile we sought that evening, it was good and we were thankful for the suggestion and tasting! 

The food was impeccable! My husband opted for the ribeye with risotto and I chose the filet with brown butter and sage gnocchi. The steaks were cooked to perfection, with visible sear marks and a salty and peppery crust. The risotto was creamy and full of sharp Parmesan flavor, while the soft pillows of gnocchi were buttery and rich. We found the steaks to be better quality, flavor, and temperature than steak houses in the area.

My only criticism was the price we paid for old fashioneds at the bar before our meal: $15 per drink! Sure, we opted for Maker’s Mark, and of course we expected Bellevue pricing, but there are far better old fashioneds at nearby restaurants offered for less (and most are on happy hour during the time we were here, which knocks the price down even more than normal). By contrast, Carmine’s offers wines in a variety of reasonable price ranges, which in a way makes the pricey cost of drinks at the bar stand out even more. 

Regardless, this was an incredibly delicious meal and a wonderful evening and we’ll be returning to Carmine’s to mark every special occasion we have. You should feel confident trusting them with your special evenings, too!"
Westcoastj,5,5,5,5,2019-09-13,Always delicious meals. The fresh fish and produce exceeds expectations. What a gorgeous restaurant with outstanding service. A favorite place to eat.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,4,4,2019-09-12,Great menu but noise level too high
epmf,3,5,1,5,2019-09-11,"Carmine's is our favorite family restaurant, where we go to celebrate all our family occasions. Last night, we were there celebrating my dad's 81st birthday, and the food was fabulous, but the service was way off the mark for Carmine's. We have been utterly spoiled in the past by their attention to detail.  
 I was utterly impressed that I received a call from the owner Maria today, apologizing for the lack of service.  She explained to me that there was a medical emergency that we were unaware of at the restaurant with two of the staff members.  Her kindness on the phone and her passion for her family restaurant reminded me why we would continue to select Carmines as our restaurant of choice.   We will be back, and we will recommend this restaurant to our friends."
Retired,5,5,5,5,2019-09-11,"Dinner was to celebrate our 43rd Anniversary.  The service in the bar and dining room was absolutely fantastic.  All the staff we encountered were great and very helpful.  Our meal was delicious and enjoyed the smaller meals.  Very surprised when a small desert was brought out in celebration of our special day.  
Thank you so much."

The service is excellent, the food outstanding, great atmosphere of energetic, positive and fun. The food from soups, to salads, to pasta to fish to ossobuco- all excellent.  Drinks were well mixed- good bar. And no rush- take your time and enjoy. Highly recommend Carmine's. It's the real deal."
Beccat,5,5,5,5,2019-09-08,The food was incredible! The service was outstanding. We were a large party with food allergies (dairy and gluten) and they went above and beyond to accommodate us.

GoodBadDog,5,5,5,5,2019-09-05,Fantastic veal. Great wine list. Perfect place to conduct business.
EdH425,5,5,5,5,2019-09-05,Great restaurant for any occasion.  The staff made our anniversary a very special evening. We'll definitely be back soon!
eatouteverynight,5,5,5,5,2019-09-04,"Excellent.  Food was great.  Pasta, veal, and halibut all wonderful. Tiramisu out of this world.

Service on timely basis. Very helpful and subdued.

Will be back soon."
Luciella,4,4,5,5,2019-09-01,"Open Table really should offer ""noise"" level beyond ""energetic"",  because when you have to use sign language to discuss your dinner order with the server, that is a PROBLEM level of noise. Conversation across the table? Forget that! No chance.  Granted it was a busy TIGF crowd, some wearing flip flops and backward baseball caps, but it IS across from the Downtown Park and it IS a lively young crowd but this is one of the few Bellevue tables that cries out for the tiniest bit of attention to wardrobe. 

Carmine's kindly phoned earlier in the day to say that a 7:30 seating had become available, much preferred to our initial 8:15 reservation, and that was much appreciated.

Drinks, wine and dinner service impeccable and the quality of menu offerings a pleasure. The evening risotto with chantrells with gorgeously grilled shrimp (more like langoustines in size and flavor) was a sparkler. Will remember to skip weekends or brush up on sign language for the next visit."
OpenTable Diner,5,4,3,4,2019-09-01,"Wine list was missing a page
Table was missing place setting for one person
Bar area is very noisy"
MidoriS,5,5,5,5,2019-09-01,"Always a wonderful dinner at Carmines, good value and great service."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-08-31,"Our waiter, Brent, made our evening a great experience.  He suggested a wine that complimented our dinner perfectly.  The halibut and pork chop main entries were cooked exactly as we wanted them. Finishing off with a complimentary Tiramisu to celebrate a birthday was perfect.  Everyone should go have a great time."
CaseyC,5,5,5,5,2019-08-31,"Lots of great options, attention to detail, try the osso bucco"
NinaS,5,5,4,4,2019-08-31,"Great food and great service!  What more can you ask?  Yes it's pricey, but worth it.  Definitely a good place to celebrate and splurge!"
None,5,5,5,5,2019-08-30,Had a great experience.  The food and service were excellent.  We have noticed the noise level is quite loud making it difficult to have a normal conversation without raising your own voice.
Happyone,5,5,5,5,2019-08-29,"Table, service, food and ambiance was perfect! Thank you!"
sessie,5,5,5,5,2019-08-28,"A lovely setting for a summer lunch.  Great lunch menu and an outstanding , though busy , waiter."
AngieD,5,5,5,5,2019-08-25,"Dinner was excellent and service outstanding. An extravagance for us but a special occasion.
Creamy cauliflower cheese soup was so light and a pleasure in the mouth! Will return for lunch just for that.
We had halibut, steak and a seafood entree and all were well prepared."
TinaC,5,5,5,5,2019-08-25,"Amazing menu, food was so delicious. Our waitress was so attentive and very kind, making sure everything was just perfect."

billieob,5,5,5,5,2019-08-24,Absolutely love everything a bout this restaurant ! You can’t go wrong here
TN59,4,4,5,3,2019-08-24,Service was cheerful and attentive but not overbearing.  Lots of attractive choices on the menu and our meals were well-prepared.  Not cheap but not outrageous.  Large open dining area is a bit noisy.  Finding the parking below the building is a safari if you skip the valet.
JustinL,5,5,5,5,2019-08-24,"Had an amazing first experience, celebrating our 2 year anniversary. Carmine's made us feel very special and celebrated. We're really looking forward to returning to our new favorite Italian spot :)"

paredepf,3,2,2,2,2019-08-22,We love this place for dinner. Lunch not so great. Poor slow service and reheated food.
TeresaM,5,5,5,5,2019-08-21,Another wonderful experience. Perfect place to relax and enjoy our anniversary!
Charles,4,4,5,4,2019-08-18,Fruit fly buzzing around table and landed in glass of wine.   Very good food overall.   Excellent service.   A bit overpriced.  Tiramisu not as good as advertised.
KathleenF,5,5,4,5,2019-08-18,The fillet con gnocchi was out of this world!  Fantastic!
ElizabethH,5,4,4,5,2019-08-16,We sat outside on a summer night and it was lovely! Food was good and there's a beautiful pink rose on each table.  We enjoyed our meal very much.

Two4Dinner,5,5,5,5,2019-08-08,A lovely evening. Food was delicious and the service was amazing.
FiSH,4,4,5,5,2019-08-08,"One of our more favorite places in Bellevue - and Seattle as well from time to time - service is always great as everyone is attentive.  Never have to ask for more water.  The shrimp and pesto pasta was again excellent as was the pork chops and the filet.  The pork chops were perfectly prepared and the risotto that came with it was equally well prepared.  The filet and the gnocchi that accompanied were also fantastic.

Only compliant - grilled calamari was fine not as great as last time.

As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary we were comped with the in house made Tiramisu which is simply amazing!

If you haven’t been here do yourself a favor and stop by for a meal!"
Wazzu,5,5,5,5,2019-08-08,Neighborhood gem. You feel you are being welcomed into someone’s home

TeresaM,5,5,5,5,2019-07-28,"We love coming to Carmine’s for a fabulous evening of amazing food. It’s a very special place and brings back such fond memories of a wonderful man. We were fortunate enough to have the same server as our previous visit and she was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Love this place!!"
StanleyS,4,5,4,4,2019-07-28,"Great service, great food and ambiance!! Keep up the good work"
Cory,3,2,5,5,2019-07-28,We’ve tried Carmine’s 4 times now and it has progressively gotten worse. The burrata appetizer was supposed to be with vegetables but it came with three tiny beet cubes and that was the 2nd best part of the meal. The best part was the side of spaghetti with the Halibut. Both mains were in real need of seasoning as was the calamari. I think we are done here.
sister,5,5,5,5,2019-07-27,Kelen was my server/bartender and he’s amazing. Attentive and helpful. We had a great time. I’ll come again.
TonyR,5,5,5,5,2019-07-26,Everything was excellent.  Food and servixe were spot on
HeidiA,5,4,5,5,2019-07-26,"Great restaurant to have quiet conversation and no blasting music.  This was my second visit and it did not disappoint.  Will return again.  

Like the white tablecloths.  Service very attentive.  Food delicious.  Did not sit outside but it is set up very lovely and will be great once the construction is done.  the planting helped to lower the noise and et a feeling of a garden.

thank you"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-07-24,So amazing! Exceeded expectations in every way. Best location in Bellevue
trseattle,5,5,5,5,2019-07-23,Sat at the bar. Great bartender. Cauliflower soup and Risotto was fantastic. Great ‘local’ Bellevue spot.
dennis,4,5,5,5,2019-07-23,Great food and the service was excellent. Little on the noisy side.
Benio,5,4,5,5,2019-07-20,We had a wonderful dinner at this place. Food was fantastic and great service. Highly recommend it!
NancyS,5,5,5,5,2019-07-20,Sat outside on a warm evening.  Enjoyed our server Ian.   The food special was delicious and the service was spot on perfect.
ThomasKellerwannaBe,5,5,5,5,2019-07-20,Carmine's might as well be in Italy; the food is divine ana always prepared to perfection.  Although a very large space its broken up into little areas so you get a ver intimate feel.  Book a table now if you like Italian food.  And don't forget the massive (and expensive) wine list.
MBC1,5,5,5,5,2019-07-19,"The restaurant was lovely our waiter was great the food was excellent this was our first visit to this restaurant and we will go again,  thank you we truly enjoyed our evening"

OpenTable Diner,3,3,4,5,2019-07-11,Portions are on the small side and the food in terms of flavor and presentation was ok. I liked the service and ambiance.
SheilaG,5,5,5,5,2019-07-09,"Gorgeous setting, fantastic service, beautiful and delicious food. Carmine’s is a lovely place to enjoy a lunch in Bellevue"
BrandonH,4,5,5,5,2019-07-07,"Great service, wonderful food. It was a little too loud with clanking dishes and lots of chatter with nowhere for the noise to go, but overall a really pretty Italian setting."
ello3,5,5,5,4,2019-07-02,"After a difficult meal at Carmine's years ago, this one was fabulous.  Wonderful pasta, risotto and halibut, and tiramisu for our anniversary for dessert.  Beautiful presentation on all the dishes, and a nice glass of a reasonably priced super Tuscan to go with.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Fairly crowded for a Monday night.  Lives up to it's Il Terrazzo roots!  Will definitely go back."
NolanF,5,5,5,5,2019-06-30,Carmine’s is by far the best Italian in the Seattle/Bellevue area. The food and service is always impeccable.
AlanB,5,5,5,5,2019-06-30,"Good food. Consistent. Good location. Great pasta, sauces and appetizers. Best Eggplant Parmigiana."
Opentablediner,5,5,5,5,2019-06-29,"I find everything at Carmine’s always so nice. Fresh flowers, nice waiters, and an endless array of choices on the menu or nightly specials. You just can’t go wrong.
It’s busy so I would recommend a reservation. We came in once on a Monday  without one, and they kindly got us a table but after a half hour wait."
JimF,3,4,5,2,2019-06-28,Was far too noisy. Could barely carry on conversation with dinner guests.  Corkage fee excessive. Probably won't return
RayH,5,5,5,4,2019-06-28,The cuisine was exceptionally good.
GailB,3,2,3,3,2019-06-28,Sorry to say the salad had wilted lettuce and the entree was marginally good.
Opentablediner,5,5,5,5,2019-06-20,"a mixture of pleasing, relaxing and/or exciting celebratory evening out..you pick.
first class service, staff and space..
Carmines 'gets it'"
BigMeatNoWhammy,4,4,2,5,2019-06-19,"We love Carmine's! However, this trip the service was pretty slow. Even after waiving our server down we waited another 15-20 minutes to order. Overall, about 60 minutes just to place an order. We ordered a second bottle of wine, got the glasses quickly but no wine! It (the bottle of wine) did eventually make it to the table.

I asked my sever for my fish to be clean, no butter. I don't like butter and don't like the salt bloat post dinner. Maybe a little olive oil but keep it simple. It is a $65 Copper river salmon. Let me actually taste the Copper.  It came out drenched in butter. Salted butter no less. I would have love to purchase another dish, but, how long would that take? I wanted to eat  within the calendar year. So, I ate my butter covered fish. To add salt to my open hunger wound, the waiter split my salad amongst the other dinners. I could have filled up on the salad but no chance of that either. 

We will go back. It is rare to have bad service at Carmine's.  However, when dropping the kind of cash we did for dinner it is unacceptable. 

The wine was good!"
nana,2,2,2,2,2019-06-18,"We waited too long between the appetizer and the main dish we ordered and ended up eating a lot of bread. When we wanted to cancel the additional order, we were told it was too late. We asked to pack the soup and the Vegetarian pasta to go and eventually we’re not charge for it, however the next day the pasta was overly cooked and super oily the soup was not eatable. Disappointing for the price we paid!"
ChrisS,5,5,5,4,2019-06-18,"Our out-of-town guests LOVED the food, the service and the atmosphere!"
OliviaB,5,5,5,5,2019-06-16,"Came here for my graduation dinner and I’m so glad I chose Carmine’s. The atmosphere and vibes of this place is extremely pleasing, felt like I was in a different country. Food was amazing and the waiters were extremely kind and helpful.
Will definitely be back soon!!"
Redwood,5,5,5,5,2019-06-16,"We always love dining at Carmine's! This is the second year we've gone there for an anniversary dinner, and they always make us feel special. The restaurant is beautiful, the food is exceptional, and all the staff members are gracious and make you feel entirely comfortable. So glad to have this wonderful restaurant on the East Side! We will be back for sure!"
Anneadriano36,5,5,5,5,2019-06-15,"Carmine’s is a great place if you want to treat yourself with great Italian food, superb wine selection and delicious desserts!  I ordered Linguine with Clam on a half and I paired it with Rosé and it was amazing!!! Will definitely come back!"
GIveMeTheFood,5,5,5,5,2019-06-15,Everything close to perfect. A tad noisy. Food excelent. Wait staff very good. I know the wine is a big profit center for restaurants these days ut at $15 a glass you would exoect a bigger poor.
RobertH,5,5,5,5,2019-06-13,"This was our first experience at Carmine's. We went there for our 55th wedding anniversary. We were treated very well, the service was excellent, the food was delicious (and I am very critical of Italian restaurant food), and they provided us with a complimentary anniversary dish for dessert. Parking was a breeze and efficient. We definitely will return to explore more of their delicious menu."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-06-13,Great food and service! I’ll go back definitely!!!
None,5,5,5,5,2019-06-13,"Our compliments to our server, Courtney.  She always provides excellent service."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-06-12,My favorite place in downtown Bellevue!
AlexaH,5,5,5,5,2019-06-09,"Best Italian restaurant in the greater Seattle area! Outstanding staff, beautiful ambiance and delicious food! It truly reminds me of being in Italy, they treat you like family and the food is very authentic. My family and I are never disappointed by Carmine's! Easily the best restaurant on the East Side."
Katrina,5,5,4,5,2019-06-09,"We went to Carmine's for our first wedding anniversary and it was wonderful. The wine selection was great (although a tad pricey). The food was perfect. The service was good, just a little slow. But not bad. We look forward to coming back soon!"
Opentablediner,5,5,5,4,2019-06-09,"Such a wonderful restaurant..
Top notch service .. I say this because it’s not possible to find this level of hospitality anywhere else.. fully engaged intelligent staff who understands their business.."
Opentablediner,5,5,5,5,2019-06-08,"We are regulars at IL Terrazzo Carmine’s for 20 years .. we were visiting friends on the eastside and we decided to take them to their favorite restaurant which was Carmine’s on the park..it’s hard to compare because although the food flavor profiles are similar, the menu, space and experience is different.. it’s hard to say which I prefer actually.. they are both beautiful with top notch ambiance and service.. I ate the most amazing tender pork chop I’ve ever had and everyone loved their evening.. we were seated next to celebrity swimmer MP’s.. that was fun!"
madison1223,1,1,1,4,2019-06-07,Carmine’s isn’t what it was even a year ago. The pasta I had was over cooked and the starter over cooked. Service was bad as we sat there feeling trapped and half wanting to just walk out with the non existent server. We had been very loyal patrons of il Terrazo but after this experience we are done. What a waste of a night at what was once a favorite dining establishment for our family.
goldreview,5,5,5,4,2019-06-06,"As usual, the dinner at Carmine's - Bellevue was excellent.  There are excellent choices on the menu, and we all enjoyed what we ordered.  The wine menu is extensive, and there are both reasonably priced wines and very expensive wines.  Our $55 bottle of Italian Pino Grigio was very good.  The wait-person was attentive and fun.  The restaurant overlooks the Bellevue Downtown Park, an added bonus.  And the noise level is ""lively"".  Overall we always find our meal experience at Carmine's to be a good time and a good value."
AzinR,5,5,5,5,2019-06-06,"Large floor plan divided into intimate sections. Great ambiance, attentive staff. Food was delicious and volume was just right. We were well fed but no take home containers needed. The presentation and playing of food was very nice. I had the duck and it was perfectly done. We were there for a birthday and they brought a dessert with candle and Happy Birthday in chocolate on the house! Love this restaurant. High end but not stuffy at all. Also great drinks from bar as well as an impressive wine list. There is parking in the back but valet is also available for a fee. Love this place."
SashaF,5,5,5,5,2019-06-04,"Very pretty inside. my request for a table placement was honored. the food was delicious and prepared properly. the service was appropriate, not too hovering and not ignoring. We will be back to try the other dishes on the menu!"
Alan,5,5,5,5,2019-06-04,First time eating at Carmine’s. Will definitely be back soon
RareTreat,4,2,5,5,2019-06-02,Came here to celebrate my husbands birthday. Love the atmosphere and ambience. Service is pretty good as well. But the food was disappointing. I got the scallop risotto. Husband got salmon special with risotto. My dish was $35 husbands was $65.  Portions were very small. No veggies or side dishes. Although I like the feel of the restaurant I wouldn’t come back again for food.
CarolL,5,5,5,5,2019-06-02,Great location and food!
plainfaire,2,3,1,2,2019-06-01,"I would not recommend anyone go on a weekend night. We sat 45 minutes before receiving drinks and wine and then it took another 25 to order dinner. The waiter was clearly working hard, but had too many tables. The noise level was very loud. On the other hand, have had some delightful lunches in the past."
CRAJ,5,5,5,5,2019-05-31,Anxious to return! One of the best restaurants in Bellevue (and Seattle).
Lisa,4,5,4,3,2019-05-30,Food was fabulous as always. The service was a bit slow with some confusion but very friendly.  The restaurant was full so the noise level was at its peak. We had a fun evening with friends and family.
JohnO,5,5,5,5,2019-05-26,My favorite restaurant on the Eastside! Always excellent!
MarshallB,5,5,5,5,2019-05-25,Perfect combination of service and always great food. Elegant but not stuffy with friendly and exceedingly knowledgeable staff.
AndyA,5,5,5,4,2019-05-25,It was our anniversary and they made it special for us - thank you.

Kenc,5,4,3,2,2019-05-21,Met friends we hadn't seen for year along with the wonderful food and service it made it a memorable night.
Lubin,5,5,5,5,2019-05-19,"Just always a pleasure! Staff and hostess are fantastic. Asked for a wine recommendation and had just a great selection chosen and our server actually wrote it down for me for future or self procurement. What can I say about the food...sweet breads with risotto...best ever!  We so enjoy Carmine’s and would highly recommend to anyone who loves good good,wine and service!"
Moe12,5,5,5,5,2019-05-18,"Had a great experience at Carmine, our server Joel was Excellent. The food is amazing. We had the saffron Risoto with scallops, Chiopino and ossobuco and they were all delightfully prepared. The wine list is excellent and you can find some good buys with the Italian wines."
CinWA,4,5,5,1,2019-05-18,"Excellent food and service,  our serving staff was fantastic and very friendly.  It is unfortunately a very noisy restaurant and we could hardly have a conversation amongst the four of us."
206sojourner,4,4,4,3,2019-05-17,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner tonight at Carmines.  Parking with validation was easy too.  My husband wanted a cream sauce instead of the pesto and they were accommodating to his request and it was delicious.  Thank you for complimentary dessert and we definitely will be back.
HoomanM,4,3,5,3,2019-05-17,"The food was good! We had the beef tartare and fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomato  the 3rd appetizer, shrimps, were ok. For the main course, we had the eggplant (I didn't try, but our companions liked it) and dryed age bon in ribeye.  The stakes had good flavor, however very chewy for a medium rare, dryed aged! We told our server and they were nice enough not to charge us for both of them!  This could be a one of, since my guests had dine here before and never experienced this.  They have a fantastic wine selection and their service is phenomenal!"
Jayvas,3,3,2,4,2019-05-13,The food served was quite ordinary.  Appetizers were too pricey and were sub par
JimH,5,5,5,5,2019-05-12,The food was incredible and the service was fantastic.
OutAndAbout,5,5,5,5,2019-05-11,Always a pleasure to dine here. Food is delicious and the service is outstanding... very attentive servers and management. Great place to go anytime but especially when the weather is nice and it's all opened up.
JeffreyD,5,5,5,4,2019-05-10,"My favorite Bellevue restaurant. Food and service is excellent. Great place for clients and friends from out of town. Big fan of the Seattle location, but since I live on the eastside, I spend more time here."
Ned47,5,5,5,5,2019-05-08,Outstanding dinner with friends.   My new favorite Bellevue restaurant!
dollface,3,3,4,4,2019-05-08,I would . All people taste is different . Very polite but too polite. They said Happy Anniversary 15 times.

OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2019-05-04,Jessica was phenomenal! Great food and location
GunawanH,5,5,5,5,2019-05-04,Wonderful food and service. Next to beautiful Bellevue park.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2019-05-02,Little loud but awesome that they recognized birthday in party.
Vinnie,3,4,1,4,2019-05-02,"I felt like our waitress was rushing us and on multiple times interrupted our conversation. There wasn't nicety or appreciation for dining here, almost felt like it was just expected to drop a few hundred dollar on dinner for three. Food was really good, but I don't feel that it warrants the high prices."
Soner,5,5,5,5,2019-05-01,We asked a quieter part of the restaurant and it was really nice. Service was attentive but not rushed. The food was really exceptional.
ShawnA,5,5,5,5,2019-04-28,Everything was excellent except it was loud in there. I would recommend still going there.
MeenaC,4,4,5,4,2019-04-28,"Carmine's is excellent. Old world Italian feel in the heart of DT Bellevue with food to match. We're picky about our Italian food, but would happily bring my Italian MIL to dine. 

There was a big party, so it was a bit noisy, but good ambience otherwise. Valet Parking (Red Carpet Valet) were terrible and we didn't even use them...its the only half mark against this restaurant...great otherwise!"
HappyLady,5,5,5,5,2019-04-27,Always friendly and welcoming. Staff is upbeat and positives if they are inviting one to dine in their home.
BestFOOD,4,5,5,3,2019-04-26,"Excellent food excellent service, a bit crowded and very noisy"
LizW,5,5,5,2,2019-04-21,The tables along the perimeter of the main dining area are set too close together and doesn’t allow enough space between the parties.  This makes it difficult to have an intimate conversation between two people with others sitting so close on either side.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,4,2019-04-20,Went there to celebrate an anniversary.   They did a great job with a special note and anniversary message during and literally part of the desert to end the evening. The service and food were fantastic.
SandraO,5,5,5,5,2019-04-20,My favorite place for dinner! Food and service amazing as always!
Disappointed,3,3,3,3,2019-04-20,"We were all (party of 7) very disappointed with: service, food, and noise level. We had to wait forever for the drinks to be served, and by the time the waiter asked if anyone would like a 2nd drink it was almost the end of the meal. Everyone ordered a starter and either their own entree or shared an entree. 50% of the food served was not tasty or prepared correctly, with components of a dish missing from the plate. My husband couldn’t even eat the mushroom soup and when the waiter noticed he said he would deduct it from the check, but didn’t. We had early dinner reservations but it was still so noisy we could barely carry on a conversation. The cost of the meal reflected an expensive restaurant, but our experience was far from that. None of us would return there or recommend it."
Opentablediner,5,5,5,5,2019-04-19,"Came on a friends recommendation and can see why this house is so busy.. Carmine’s is a well oiled machine, with beautiful food, drinks and staff. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with fresh flowers everywhere you turn. Everyone that serves is clearly happy and fully engaged from front desk on.
What other places aspire to but rarely achieve..Carmine’s gets it."
Rtn34,5,5,4,5,2019-04-14,This Carmine location Is fantastic. Glad they kept the same menu as the downtown restaurant. Always enjoy my time here!
YvonneH,3,3,5,2,2019-04-14,Service is excellent. Food is mediocre. Decor is bland and sterile.
MarkH,5,5,5,5,2019-04-13,"We celebrated our anniversary with another couple, and Carmine's was very attentive all night - it really made us feel special.
Our guest brought a special bottle of champagne and the Carmine's staff made sure we were served properly. The food was great and our guests were very impressed since it was their first visit there. We'll be back!"
PramodB,5,5,5,5,2019-04-12,"I booked a table to celebrate my wife's birthday at Carmine's. Both of us are vegetarians and we were apprehensive about whether this place would have any options for us, but we were surprised with the food and wine options. The potato dumpling and the creme of Asparagus were amazing. Thanks for the birthday cake."
kenp,3,3,3,3,2019-04-12,Presentation is very good but food does not seem to be the same caliber as when they opened.
Cynthia,5,5,5,4,2019-04-11,Service was impeccable. We asked for the quietest table secondary to a hearing deficit and it was still too loud.
Josh,5,5,5,5,2019-04-11,"We've been to Carmine's a few times, and every time is outstanding! Our server Hayley(believe that was her name) was great. My girlfriend has a severe beef allergy, and they are always super helpful wish dishes. Great place to dine!!"
Miki,3,1,5,3,2019-04-10,"Beautiful restaurant with excellent service, but the food is not good at all. In our opinion, the Carmine’s in downtown Seattle is much better."
MFoodie,5,5,5,5,2019-04-10,"My family & I are regulars at Carmine's in Bellevue. We love the atmosphere and the food is fantastic. Favorites include Antipasti appetizer, Brown Butter Sage Gnocchi, Veal Scallopini, The Lamb Chops & Pork Chops."
MicheleL,5,5,5,5,2019-04-10,Great service as always with alberto and the food never disappoints
WaGal,5,5,5,4,2019-04-09,Would have been nice to know there was a garage with parking.  Noise level is pretty loud- hard to hear our server.  Outstanding panna cotta and double pork chop.
RogerA,5,5,5,5,2019-04-07,Great service!  Great food. Great place!
JenniferG,5,5,5,5,2019-04-06,Carmine's is our favorite restaurant!   We always take our friends and family here for special occasions because we know the service and meals will always be amazing.
Steph,5,5,5,5,2019-04-05,The service was lovely and the recommendations were perfect!
MarkB,4,5,5,5,2019-04-05,This was our first time at Carmine’s we were celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary. Both my wife and I loved Carmine’s. We would recommend it highly. Phil and his team were outstanding. We will be back.
danw00,5,5,5,4,2019-04-05,Coco's service at our table was exemplary - we'd definitely like to be at one of her tables when we come back!  The osso bucco was fantastic - so good
Alany,5,5,5,5,2019-04-02,"Our dinner was on a Monday evening, celebrating a birthday, and there were two other parties doing the same, so it was not at all crowded, and clearly a place chosen for special occasions. The service was excellent. Food was great. We can recommend the Caesar salad, and the King Salmon dish with risotto."
MargieS,5,5,5,5,2019-03-30,Great meal!  Excellent service.  We have been here twice and it's been great both times.
SandieC,2,1,5,4,2019-03-30,Although service was excellent food was horrible. Neither we will go back there nor recommend this restaurant to others.
CarlB,3,3,4,4,2019-03-30,Nice for a couple to have a few glasses of wine
JamesS,5,3,5,5,2019-03-30,"Our server and the front greeting staff were both A+. Attentive and professional. My wife ordered the seafood linguini and I ordered the bone in pork chop. My wife loved the seafood linguini. Me?  Well the pork chop was not great. I ate two bites. The servers noticed that I was not eating, and came back to thaw the pork chop away. They apologized and immediately brought me a feee desert and took the pork chop off my bill. We were very impressed of this level of friendly service. We will be back to eat there again."
Would,5,5,4,5,2019-03-29,"I have been to Carmine's five times for business and pleasure with family. All I can say is amazing. Each time I am surprised, in a good way, by something. This time was a business lunch with an old colleague, we needed a catch-up and to establish a way forward.  We agreed it was wonderful, lasted just long enough, and the food - well off the charts."
RebmcL,5,5,5,5,2019-03-29,Best Salad Niciose I’ve ever had!  Everyone loved their meal.
Grandmere,5,5,5,4,2019-03-28,"We had dinner with friends at Carmine's and had a wonderful time.  The food was wonderful, the service was impeccable, and we will definitely return.  Can't wait."
Jazzyjazmin,5,5,5,5,2019-03-28,Roberto and Brett were incredible! The atmosphere was amazing!! We will definitely be back!
Eatout8,5,5,5,5,2019-03-27,"Delicious pasta, seamless service, and lots of smiles.  Love Carmine's."
Diningfun,5,5,5,5,2019-03-26,"Just love everything about Carmines. The food, service, and ambiance can’t be beat! I could go there every night of the week!"
VicS,5,5,5,4,2019-03-25,Delicious food and great service.
LaurenceC,3,4,3,3,2019-03-24,"If you are sitting in the wrong part of the restaurant the noise is unbearable!
We could not have a decent conversation and our ears were ringing by the end of the evening. Make sure you ask for a quiet table otherwise your money will be wasted!
Great food and service though!"
InnaA,5,5,4,4,2019-03-24,"Great place for classic Italian dinner, just be ready to pay.  If  you are looking for a place where you can talk over the dinner- this place is not for you. Perfect spot to bring grandparents."
Emmy,5,5,5,5,2019-03-23,Fun location and great good!
davidf,5,5,5,4,2019-03-23,as usual great service and wonderful food.  ENjoyed the entire experience.
JanisG,5,5,5,5,2019-03-23,"We come every year for my husband's birthday, he counts the days until he has his sweet bread. This year pancetta was added and he felt it was a bit overpowering. No worries he will just adjust his sweet bread order. I had the specific Rib Eye it was huge but somehow when my plate was cleared it was empty. We will see you again."
BarryS,4,3,4,4,2019-03-22,"Like Carmine's quite a bit.  Hosted a private dinner for 14 in January and it was great.  Dinner the other evening was not up to par.  Food was just mediocre and we shared our views with the staff.  They attempted to make it right but comping the pasta and bringing a desert does not make up for the loss of the total experience.  My partner has Parkinson's and not sure how many more dining ""experiences"" we will have together.  So when one goes bad we notice it."
JerseyBlues,4,4,5,3,2019-03-22,Nice place. Authentic cuisine. Table was in high traffic area. Ask for one by a window for more intimate experience
phil,5,5,5,5,2019-03-19,"Wonderful meal, perfect food and beverage experience!  As good as the original"
EatItAll,5,5,5,5,2019-03-17,"Food was absolutely amazing, the care they put into that and making you feel like family is perfection!"
DavidC,4,4,5,4,2019-03-17,"Great date night restaurant. Our server was very attentive and always on top of things. The only drawback was the two-person table could be a little more spacious. Felt good just for drinks, but having drinks, appetizers and main entree get little tight."
NancyS,5,5,5,5,2019-03-17,Just overall professionalism and attention.  Like the personable staff and all their smiles.  Great service.
MIrandaT,5,5,5,5,2019-03-16,Superior food and incredible service! This restaurant never fails to deliver an excellent dining experience whether you’re on a date night or special celebration. PAOLA is by far the best waiter in Seattle- a skilled professional with a personal touch. You will not be disappointed!
fendi,5,5,5,5,2019-03-16,"Wonderful food and service!  
Second time at the Bellevue location, we usually make the trip downtown - 
but this is more convenient to Issaquah."
JamesR,5,5,4,4,2019-03-16,The food was excellent. Our waiter was exceptional but the busboy had a serious frown on his face. Whenever he would fill out glass of water he seemed angry. Everyone else was smiling and friendly. I would have given a perfect 10 except for this experience.
KariW,4,3,4,3,2019-03-16,Delicious food as always.  I do have to modify my meals at most places to be gf and df and they complied but not with much creativity. Have the waiters and waitresses wear something else besides the ugly and ill fitting head waiter jackets. They dont look comfy wearing them. Would love a cocktail menu as well.
KristinaK,5,5,5,5,2019-03-15,"Paul was an amazing server! The entire staff is welcoming and kind. We felt like we were transported to Italy. From the beginning to end, there was a great attentiveness to detail. Food tasted delicious! Cannelloni is really good here. And birthday dessert was a cherry to the top. They make birthdays special here. Loved it! Will be back."
Michael,5,5,5,5,2019-03-15,Nothing beats Carmine's for a world-class italian meal
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2019-03-14,Awesome overall.  Excellent food and great staff.  Highly recommend!!
BobK,5,5,5,5,2019-03-13,Best place for lunch (or dinner) in Bellevue; enough said.
FelixL,3,1,3,4,2019-03-13,"The steak was absurdly bad, I should’ve known better than to order a steak at an Italian joint but you’d think a 50 dollar steak anywhere should be devoid of tendons and jibberish in every bite. I ended up spitting out half of the masticated beef cause I couldn’t get it down... pasta seemed good thou, but damn... that steak was almost worst than dennys"
MichaelM,5,5,5,5,2019-03-12,The best salmon I have ever had!
Kyle1,5,5,4,4,2019-03-10,"2nd time celebrating at Carmine’s.  Love it!
Great service, food and ambiance!!"
Ninjas,5,5,4,5,2019-03-10,"Foods were excellent. I had  king salmon .  It was cooked just right  Meat were very tender and delicious. I liked it very much.  Highly recommended. If you like to dine in a fancy place with tasty foods, this is one of the best place to go. Table setting was nice. The only negative is noise level. It was a bit difficult in hearing the conversation."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-03-09,I reserved Carmines for my husband’s birthday dinner. The staff was great. They made special effort to make our evening special by serving complimentary tiramisu with a birthday message. The food was outstanding. Highly recommend. We will visit again.
Eatoutyes,4,4,5,4,2019-03-09,"We enjoyed our dinner at Carmine's.  The staff was excellent.  The restaurant is noisy, so I wouldn't call it romantic.  The bruschetta appetizer was excellent.  The caesar salad was a real disappointment; I make a better one out of a package from the grocery store.  My husband had lamb.  He said it was very good, but not superb.  I had an excellent filet mignon, but the gnocchi that came with it was uninspired.  The lemon meringue dessert was, for me, the best part of the meal.  As meringues go, it was wonderfully done.  My husband said his profiteroles were very good--it is a dessert meant for two, though!  We would go there again, although we would definitely skip the salad course and go for one of their less pricey entrees."
LynnP,5,5,5,5,2019-03-08,"We celebrated 2 birthdays; my husbands and my girlfriends. The 4 of us sat in the lounge and had dinner. The service from the minute we walked in and the hostess sat us to our waiter who was also the bartender was impeccable! 3 of us had the scallop and risotto special, King Salmon and pasta Italian sausage...all amazing!"
ArmandA,4,5,5,3,2019-03-08,Excellent food and service. Noise level above tolerable to the point I had to shout to my companion to have a conversation.
Kay88,5,5,5,5,2019-03-05,This is the only place in all of Bellevue worth eating. It is exceptional in every way. The best every single time.
Sophie,4,3,4,5,2019-03-05,"I used to love Carmine’s food but this time, I was very disappointed with the quality of duck breast.  In addition risotto was strange. It does not taste like risotto at all.  Surprisingly  cioppino tastes quite bland as well.  Thank god that  vodka cream source pasta was  still delicious.   Given this not so great experience, I am not sure that I will  go back again."
MarkM,3,3,5,3,2019-03-03,"Good food, great service, but way too loud for a nice dinner for two."
MartinR,3,4,1,4,2019-03-02,"Our food was significantly delayed
Both tables next to us were seated after us and were served before us, in fact the table to our right turned over twice before we got our food.
They did apologize and offered us free dessert"
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-03-02,Very attentive service. their food is delicious.
RyanK,5,5,5,5,2019-03-01,Great place to celebrate a birthday. Service was amazing along with the food. Highly recommend.
MollyC,5,5,5,5,2019-02-26,"Carmine's is always my ""Go to"" place to gather for with friends or family to celebrate an occasion, or to just have a romantic evening with my husband. Food is always wonderful, as is the service."
Carey,5,5,5,5,2019-02-24,"This was my first time here at the recommendation of a friend and I was VERY impressed.  From the moment I walked in.  From the service to the food, this is a wonderful place and I will return many times!"
blueangel2,5,4,5,4,2019-02-22,"A new client treated my wife and I to dinner at Carmine's.  As always Carmines was an outstanding dining experience.  The service from Ian was friendly, professional and sets a high bar for Bellevue."
Mradovic,4,5,4,4,2019-02-20,"Excellent food, decent service and atmosphere.  They’ve acknowledged our anniversary, much appreciated."
Josh,5,5,5,5,2019-02-20,The food was amazing. Everyone took great care of us and made our dining experience amazing.
Vika,5,5,5,5,2019-02-20,Always a pleasure to come back.  The food is exceptionally delicious!
ToddJ,5,5,5,5,2019-02-19,"Unobtrusive service with impeccable timing 
Table side French service is a nice touch
Outstanding food quality with possibly the best Caesar I have ever had"
DomC,4,4,4,4,2019-02-17,Great Italian restaurant in the heart of Bellevue. I ordered the pesto fettuccine with prawns & if you’re pesto lover like myself then you will love this dish. I can’t wait to go back.
Aldona,5,5,4,5,2019-02-17,"Everything was great about the evening except the valet.  Food was great, service was excellent, it's a expensive, but very good."
SusanR,5,5,5,4,2019-02-17,We had a wonderful experience! Our waitor was very nice and helpful - not snooty at all. Food was great!  Best bread and bruscetta ever! We will be back!
Rose,5,5,5,5,2019-02-16,"Wonderful experience, food and service. We arrived early and used valet. There were two seats at the bar and we had a drink and appetizer while we waited for our table. The bar staff were very friendly. The table was ready right at our reservation time and again, service was wonderful. We went with the two specials tomahawk steak and risotto with crab cakes. So glad we did because they were both exceptional. The steak in particular was perfectly cooked and had an amazing peppercorn crust."
MelanieK,4,4,4,4,2019-02-16,We made reservations via open-table and was seated on a four top in the middle of the dining room. My waitress was pretty busy with a 5 top and 4 top and 2 top in my area. I had the cauliflower soup as a starter and the ossobucco for dinner. The wine list came when dinner came and a waiter came by to help us pick a suitable wine in short order. Although the food was good it could have been 5 stars with more Italian zest and pop.
stephenh,3,2,4,4,2019-02-15,"nope service and ambiance is good but the food just was no where near where it should of been. I would of preferred burger king, or a nice steak joint or almost anywhere."
Aben,5,5,5,5,2019-02-15,"Carmine’s is the best Italian in Bellevue. We went for our third Valentine’s Day in a row and it’s the best experience you could ask for. Amazing wine, bolognese, lobster risotto, wine, etc. Such a beautiful space, too!"
Sharon,5,5,5,4,2019-02-15,"This was our first time at the Carmine's in Bellevue...even though we've been to the one in Seattle.  We enjoyed it VERY much.  Food was delicious and service excellent.  It equals the Seattle restaurant, but is much easier to get to for us.  We will definitely go back whenever we want yummy Italian food.  It is a high-end restaurant for sure, but we think it's worth the price."
Dionysia,5,5,5,5,2019-02-15,"One of the best restaurants in Bellevue.  The food, service and ambiance are just top notch. It is a great choice for any special occasion."
Daniel,5,5,5,5,2019-02-15,Always a great time and the food is fantastic. Love the friendly staff.
ThomasKellerwannaBe,5,5,5,5,2019-02-15,"This place is amazing -- the food is exquisite and the wine list massive ($$$).  Love going here, the staff are so amazing."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-02-14,When you want a really good meal this is the place to go....if you’re looking in for “foam” or avant garde ingredients then try somewhere else.....and that’s what is great about this place.
JoeS,5,5,5,5,2019-02-08,Tanya was and always has been a great waitperson.  Please let her know how much we appreciate her.
MFoodie,5,5,5,5,2019-02-05,"We love Carmine’s. We probably dine there once a month. The food is fantastic (our favorite in Bellevue), the service is great and the atmosphere is beautiful. The only negative is when the restaurant is busy it’s quite loud in there. They always take great care of us! We’re already looking forward to our next visit."
SPWS,5,5,5,5,2019-02-03,Everything was perfect.
MeggenW,5,5,5,5,2019-02-03,"Outstanding dinner, wine and service. We will most certainly add this to our list of places to go for a special night out."
JohnS,4,5,5,4,2019-02-03,"VERY LOUD!
AND TABLES ARE VERY CLOSE... THE LOCATION IN SEATTLE IS MORE INTIMATE"
john,5,5,5,5,2019-02-03,"Great service and the food was fantastic.  We had salmon, veal, rigatoni, and some good wine.   Wine is a little pricey. The noise level was appropriate for a good restaurant with good energy."
GovindR,5,5,5,5,2019-02-02,"Excellent service, food and ambience. A must try in Seattle."
DenverDiner,4,4,5,4,2019-02-02,Very noisy space but experience made up for it.
JenniferA,5,5,5,5,2019-02-02,"Tried Carmine’s for the first time to celebrate my brother’s birthday. They had a nice Happy Birthday card on the table, which was nice. Food was great, service was awesome will most definitely be back!"
Krisinseattle,4,4,5,5,2019-01-31,"We had a lovely lunch there. The service was excellent. The food, however, was very expensive, especially for lunch!  The special black cod was a very small piece, excellently prepared, on a very small helping of risotto. The only accompaniment was a very small carrot and 5 green beans. This fetched a $40 price at lunch. The tiramisu was a lovely ending. Bring your wallet!"
DavidK,5,5,5,5,2019-01-31,I love this place! You have to try the Osos Bucco.
LPstanding,2,4,3,1,2019-01-30,"It was so loud and they had so many groups that our party of 7 could not talk without literally shouting at eachother to be heard. And we were even seated in the corner! They had several very large groups and one in particular that would have been better suited at a sports bar than a fine dining establishment.

We’ve loved our visits in the past but our evening was ruined when we couldn’t hold a conversation because of the noise level."
luv2dine,5,4,5,4,2019-01-29,"Celebrating my husband's 90th.....ate in the bar which has nice ambiance.  Altho the bartender's booming voice is somewhat a distraction,  it beat the large group in the banquet room near the other tables.  We enjoyed out selections -  my husband really liked his osso bucco, something that he does not get at home.  My cream of cauliflower soup was wonderful, by sm order of pasta with pesto and prawns was ok but nothing special.  We shared the cannoli, a favorite of ours but hard to match what I had in Sicily many trips ago.  
A nice evening in an upscale, rather expensive restaurant."
Kyle1,5,5,5,5,2019-01-27,Wonderful place to celebrate a birthday or special occasion.
TonyW,5,5,5,5,2019-01-27,"My wife and I love Carmine's - both in Seattle and Bellevue.  We have become frequent diners at the Bellevue location because it is near our home, and we really prefer the bar atmosphere in that location to the Seattle location (although, Intermezzo is a really nice choice for bar atmosphere).  Our go to meal is generally to share the antipasti plate, and then each choose an entrée and then share a bottle of Italian wine.  The wine list is really great, and it has everyone's favorites from the Northwest, which is really great, and sometimes we go in that direction, but, we mostly like to let the staff pick out a bottle of Italian wine for us since we don't know those wines well.  On our latest visit, we dined in the dining room, and Kellen was our waiter.  really great guy who is passionate about food and wine.  We have also dined at the chef's table/bar that overlooks the kitchen.  That is also fun -- my favorite dish is the veal rib chop, and my always goes with their fresh fish selection.  And, their pastas are always first rate, too, and it's nice that you can share."
Bellman,3,3,4,3,2019-01-27,"We have dined at Il Terrazzo's in Seattle and it is one of our favorite places. Carmine's in Bellevue is far from the experience at Il Terrazzo's. The food lacked character, the noise level was terrible, the service was good and the prices were too much for what was being offered. We won't be going there again. It was an expensive mistake!"
Brian,5,5,5,5,2019-01-27,"This has to be one of the best restaurants in Bellevue. Such good food, and very attentive wait staff. Highly recommend eating here!"
Bambam,5,5,5,5,2019-01-23,Everything was perfect!
Pab58,4,4,4,4,2019-01-22,"We arrived for an early supper and were greeted warmly and led to a nicely private table. Which was good because I find most restaurants too noisy these days. 
On wait person was at ease and genuine. Another nice trait. 
Our food although not deserving of 5 stars, would be a solid four. The wine list was strong and had a good variety. Dinner and wine for 4 was $500. $200 of that being wine."
AprilH,4,5,3,4,2019-01-20,Great food. Had the risotto special with crab cake and my friend had the bolognese. Both were excellent. We had a great bottle wine recommendation from the sommelier after giving him our price point. Downside of visit was the table we were given. Horrible place to sit right next to pillar. Also our service was quite slow. Dessert was delicious. I had panna cotta and my friend had fruit and cheese plate. Beautiful restaurant!
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-01-19,Always amazing!
AnhN,5,5,5,5,2019-01-19,Overall it was a fantastic experience. Food was priced reasonably.  The staff were friendly and very eccentric.
CrystalM,5,5,5,5,2019-01-19,"Our server was amazing, I can remember his name- but had glasses and red hair. He recommended great dishes and was so kind to our daughter. The food was amazing, our drinks were on point. This was a great experience."
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,3,2019-01-18,AMAZING - staff is unbelievable and the food is spectacular
Sunflower,5,5,5,5,2019-01-18,"Carmines is a very warm & inviting restaurant.  The food is good & the service is excellent.  We met friends & tried a bunch of dishes family style.  They have changed  the Bruschetta recipe think  I like the one they had earlier better.  
Will be back."
RLTEastside,5,4,5,4,2019-01-18,Always outstanding service and very friendly.  Excellent food and a very nice presentation.
OpenTable Diner,5,5,5,5,2019-01-18,"Luise is the best!  He is a fantastic server, and the food is fantastic.  Bravo!"
AprilC,5,5,5,5,2019-01-18,Carmine's is great. Our office has been many times and everything is amazing especially our waitress who we have had the pleasure of being served by many times. It is great to return to a restaurant after not visiting for 6 months and see the staff is the same and the food is still just as delicious!!
Nomad46,5,5,5,4,2019-01-17,"Never disappoints...great food, excellent service"
Sammamish,2,2,4,3,2019-01-13,"I have been at Carmines three times before this past weekend.  Every business has an off night - I was just surprised Carmine's had one at all.  Besides the deafening noise reflected by the glass in the corner (patio door and main window), the pasta was overcooked and very crunchy.  Kellan, the waiter, explained that the noodles are cooked in the morning and heated up later for dinner.  Since our party ate at 5pm at the first sitting, we caught the worst of this pre-preparation.  The prior times I have been to Carmine's have been excellent, other than the noise levels.  The manager came over and gave us one dinner free, which was indicative of the customer service you can expect there.  So a little disappointing, but I will come back in a few months.  They cannot take the name for granted and ride on the Seattle flagships coattails.  There are too many great options in Bellevue, Kirkland now, even in Redmond."
