Great dinner, but noise level is high.', 'A great place to have a birthday! Thank you, I will be returning. The food was good, the overall vibe of the restaurant was good.

This is the 3rd try over the past 3 yrs and it continues to validate our assessment that price are 2x the value.  It's over-rated and just good not great.\", 'We live Carmines! Always delicious and wonderful waitstaff!!!!', 'ALEX was incredible! He was very cordial, professional, debonair, knowledgeable, helpful, and truly caring about our experience!', 'Amazing as always!!! Sat in the bar tonight and had great service!', 'Our first time visiting Carmines. Food was delicious and service was amazing! Definitely would be back again.', 'Great patio ceiling heaters.  Loved the quiet garden atmosphere on the patio.  Halibut was delicious.', 'great food and great service! Only critique is that tables are very close together which causes noise volume to be loud- especially when my two top is sat between two large 5+ seat tables.\\nWill definitely be back!', 'Fantastic service.  Delicious food.  Wonderful surroundings.  Perfection!', 'Again always great food and service. Hooked on meatballs. Best place to enjoy a casual long lunch', 'It was a lovely meal, with excellent service.  We will be back.', 'Carmines is one of our favorite restaurants.  The food is always great.  The staff is wonderful.  We always enjoy our time there.  We will be back in a few weeks.  Highly recommend it.', 'We had an excellent lunch today and we brought in an old California Cabernet Sauvignon.  They immediately offer to decant it for us and of course we shared a glass of the wine with the waitperson.   Food and service were terrific, and we are looking forward to our next visit.', 'My first time here. Food, atmosphere and bar experience was great. What wasn’t so great was our experience with our waitor. Did not make us feel welcome and made us feel rushed. Without introduction or summarizing the specials, he just said “are you ready to order?”\\nBecause we didnt want to reward bad behavior with our tip, we requested a new waitor and she was wonderful! Without telling her of our experience she gave an introduction, summarized the specials, and gave us her recommendations. Overall good. Because everyone other than the first waitor was great, it’s not a reflection of the establishment. Will return again.', 'Food and service were excellent.  Noise level was super high and lighting was very low to the point that one of us had trouble reading his menu and seeing his food ( does have vision problems).', 'Fantastic service and good as always. Thank you Carmines', 'Go hungry and be prepared for a fabulous meal! The Caprese, Caesar, Linguini Vongole, and Salmon pasta dishes were exceptional as was the fresh warm bread basket. The wine was also very good. We had a great bottle during our previous visit however this time, we only wanted a glass to accompany our meal. Since the wine could only be purchased by the bottle, our server brought us a couple of samples to try. Kudos for going the extra mile! He described it as local and fairly priced. Our mistake because we didn’t ask the price…yikes…it was $25/ glass. Wont be doing that again!', 'Celebrated my mom’s 66th birthday at Carmines with our toddler in tow. Carmine’s host seated us promptly and our server couldn’t have been nicer and more accommodating. Each item we ordered was brought out in a timely manner, beautiful presentation and tasted delicious. Standouts for us were the Caesar salad, gambaroni and cioppino. Can’t go wrong with tiramisu for dessert.', 'Amazing as always! The gnocchi is the best ever! I wish I could come here every day.', 'Tremendous experience. We came to celebrate my mom’s birthday and had an amazing time from start to finish. Everyone was very accommodating, friendly, and we can’t wait to come back!\\n\\nItems ordered:\\n-Prosciutto con melone (appetizer)\\n-Extra dirty grey goose martini with blue cheese olives. If you love blue cheese like I do, these are a must!\\n- Risotto Tiberio. Ive had this here before and it was so amazing. Perfectly cheesy and fluffy with generous servings of seafood.\\n- Crab Rigatoni - so creamy and the crab was just perfection.\\n- Spaghetti di finochio + meatball. Trust me the meatball is worth it! It’s stuffed with cheese and just so good. That you can get a la carte! The spaghetti was so good with a delicious creamy pesto.\\n- Tiramisu and Bourbon Bread pudding were also amazing!', 'Beautiful ambiance, great service. Does time there for anniversary and they treated us well!', 'The sautéed squid appetizer was so well balanced and flavorful.', 'Wonderful food and service.  Always friendly, knowledgeable people.  These servers are top notch!', 'We have eaten at Carmines multiple time’s.   Each and every time has been a fantastic experience.  Our server Matthew was absolutely fantastic last night.  Could not have had a better dinner.  Thank you so much.', \"It was a fantastic lunch. Filet mignon came with the daily special salad was out of heaven. Cod chowder and ragu with rigatoni were very hearty. The server was attentive and helpful. Somewhat unimpressed were NA cocktail berry spritz and NY steak which I had to put more salt to taste.\\n\\nOverall a very good experience. I am very happy that I finally tried Carmine's today and will definitely revisit soon.\", 'Carmine’s continues to be THE EXAMPLE of how to EXCEED EXPECTATIONS!!!! Been a devout patron for years.  Never disappointed!!!!', 'Exceptional experience! We dined on the well landscaped patio which provided privacy despite being busy.  Jeff was our server & he provided helpful suggestions especially since it was our first visit to Carmines.  Our meal was fresh and beautifully presented. Each course from the wine, caprese & Caesar salads, halibut,linguini vongole, and desserts was just perfect! We look forward to returning another day.', 'Always excellent, Roberto runs a tight and excellent ship! Carl B', 'It was a very hot day in the PNW (90degrees) and the restaurant had their doors open. If the air conditioning was on it wasn’t keeping up. It just made things uncomfortable. The food and service was amazing, it was just very hot!', 'Carmine’s is exceptional. A classic with modern edge in the heart of Bellevue. Love sitting at the sidewalk corner table and watching all the action with tasty bits and drinks. Tremendous favorite for  lunch.', \"There staff was amazing. We don't live here but I'd come back for sure when we visit again. Perfect risotto. Amazing halibut\", 'Our waiter was fabulous. He was extremely attentive and had great suggestions for what we might like. It was a delicious meal with impeccable service as always, and a wonderful atmosphere.', 'The evening was great!! Our server was knowledgeable of the menus and the specials. She was very attentive and well informed. The food and atmosphere was phenomenal! My husband and I will definitely be dining at Carmine’s again.', 'Celebrated anniversary', 'The best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best!!!!!!!!!!!', \"Lunch for my friend's birthday with her elderly mother from out-of-town. Expectations were high based on past dining experiences. We had La CapreseBuffala mozzarella for appetizer, tomatoes were heirloom quality, their house bread (with the perfect chew factor IMO) was offered multiple times,  although I wished it was warmed, the butter was soft; the best part of lunch was the d Cream of cauliflower Gratinée, delicious, flavorful, rich, but not overly so. Entrees were Clam Linguine, with a generous portion of clams, Caesar Salad, nicely prepared and Spaghetti Ortolano, was lackluster, I think they forgot to toss in the olive oil.  The two desserts were both worth every bite: tiramisu (in fact I took an additional slice home) and lemon meringue was Instagram worthy. \\n\\nLunch is not usually the best showing for any fine restaurant and that needs to be taken into consideration. The restaurant itself is impeccably cared for, clean, bright, beautiful. The experience was not as hoped for, no mention of celebrating a special occasion, even though I had noted it. I will say the owner called me after I left a note about the experience and I do believe this less than 5 star experience was an anomaly. I will go back and still cannot think of another restaurant in Seattle that I'd rather have a special meal.\", 'We celebrated our Anniversary. Carmine’s was a great choice!', 'I highly recommend this establishment, everything is very tasty and beautiful', 'Exquisite experience. I heard they’re opening a new downtown Seattle location on 5th and Pike. Can’t wait for that.', 'Oh my God Carmine’s is always so noisy when it’s full of fabulous people. Our waitress Kat was amazing super sweet food was delicious as always.', 'Carmines in Bellevue is excellent.  We had a dinner reservation just as they opened for dinner.  They grew very busy throughout our dinner, but service did not diminish.  Food and beverage was excellent, aw was location and price. We were there for our anniversary, but will return before the next one.', 'We came here for my friends bachelorette party…\\nSERVICE: Impeccable. They were able to change my reservation and squeeze us in at an earlier time. They had a congratulations card waiting for her at the table. The staff were all congratulating her throughout the night. And they brought her a complimentary piece of tiramisu cake with Congratulations written in cursive with chocolate \\nFOOD: Delectable. Their pastas were delicious and the dessert 10/10. I had the pesto fettuccini with prawns and devoured my meal\\nAMBIENCE: Romantically Elegant. I recommend this for dates, celebrations, special occasions, birthdays. Candle and fresh flowers at the tables.', 'Always great food and service they cannot do enough for you', 'The ambiance was beautiful, the service first class and food was delicious with reasonably priced dishes for a special night out.', 'Super great waiter. Food was outstanding. Great experience overall!', 'Carmines delivers an elegant setting with wonderful service! I love the daily fresh specials that are recommended by the waiters. The homemade dessert selection was amazing as are the wine pairings.', 'Outstanding service and food.  Very pricey, however, it was a special occasion.', 'Carmine’s is first class dining all the way.  Our server was outstanding…the food was amazing.  However…sitting inside is LOUD.  And I’d love a hint on how to reserve a good table on a Monday evening — in the notes I wrote this was a BIG birthday for me and the first table we were shown was marginal at best in a walk way…we settled on a table still in a walk way and servers without apology kept bumping into my chair….sigh.', 'Dinner was superb ! Absolute perfection from start to finish. What a wonderful way to celebrate my birthday!\\nThank you Steven for being such an attentive and professional wait person.', 'Excellent food and good service.  However - don’t go if it’s a hot day in Bellevue. Inside the dining room was so uncomfortably hot, it took away our appetite.  (Apparently they have no AC.).  Typically at this restaurant, we give all 5 star reviews.  This was definitely NOT our normal experience at Carmine’s.', 'A frequent diner at Carmines. This trip was really average.  Felt like server was in a big hurry, gluten free pasta not good.  Super Tuscan wine was outstanding.  Felt very overpriced for the quality of the meal.', 'The service, quality of the food, thoughtful preparation and taste were exceptional.  Our server, Alberto G, made our day even more special with amazing service and a great personality.', 'Dinner was lovely and our entire experience was fabulous. We had the cioppino, veal scallopine, lobster special and the rigatoni bolognese and all were excellent. Service was also superb led by Matthew!  Thanks to the entire team at Carmine’s for making a special occasion even more remarkable.', \"Just excellent! You won't be disappointed with a meal here!\", \"Carmine's was excellent as usual!  The ambiance is inviting, the food was delicious and the service\\nwas very attentive!  Went there with 3 friends to celebrate one of their birthdays.  We all enjoyed our meals very much.  The eggplant parmegiana, the salmon special and a shrimp dish were all expertly prepared and presented.  The complementary piece of Tiramisu to celebrate my friend's birthday was a nice gesture too.\", 'Could be better.\\nI guess the restaurant is so famous that is not trying to be better.\\nService was good although hostess was on the phone for 3 minutes or more while we were waiting.\\nVeal meat was not tender, that dish needs to get better.', 'It was the perfect setting for a summer birthday celebration for our family.The service was exceptional especially by our server Alexei, and we will definitely be back!', 'A bit noisy and proxy but excellent food and service', 'Absolutely amazing, to be honest for the price the atmosphere, location and food it was well worth any check. Would definitely recommend 100% to anyone who loves fine dining and a great atmosphere. Will be going back.', 'Update to my initial review….Roberto from the restaurant followed up from my poor review and experience and expressed that they wanted to make it right.  They credited the meal off my bill and offered a gift card on my next visit.  This was certainly great customer follow thru and they went above and beyond to show they really care. Thank you to Roberto and Carmines on great customer service!\\n\\nInitial review….I ordered the double bone-in pork chop and it was very dry!  I was very disappointed in the quality.', 'Our server Matthew was exceptional.  Everything was top notch.', 'MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE UNITED STATES! Seriously, you cannot find better service, better food, better ambience elsewhere. Praise be to this institution.', \"An amazing experience from the moment you enter through the beautiful patio.

Ron suggested some lemon wedges to put in his water to make it extra special & that did the trick, our son was thrilled.\\n\\nRon told us about the daily specials and made great recommendations. I mentioned that I wanted to try something new since I always get the crab risotto or the veal. Ron said the halibut was really good, and that they do halibuts really well. It came with on a bed of parmesan risotto with saffron sauce and some veggies. I love their risottos (crab, lobster etc) so I decided on this dish, my husband followed. We absolutely loved it! If you love caesar salad like we do, Carmine's have one of the best caesars around! The dressing has a hint of green like pesto, makes it extra special. They always make up a special plate (kids portion) for our son (spaghetti with one big meatball). They are pretty good about making up a special plate that is not on the menu.

He greeted us, asked about drinks and walked away before we could order because my daughter asked about mocktails. He came back about 20 minutes later and we ordered drinks, a bottle of wine and appetizers. Our appetizers were delivered before our wine was opened. He just left the unopened bottle of wine on the table. We were nearly 50 minutes into our reservation time before the wine was opened and served.\\n\\nI’ve never spent $600 on a dinner to be treated so poorly. The consensus across the board was excellent food (except the crab risotto which was fishy),beautiful and festive atmosphere, but not worth being treated like we’re beneath another person.\\n\\nEdit: The owners from Carmine contacted me this morning.

It was very loud when we first arrived, but as the tables emptied the noise level was pleasant.  I had a pasta dish that was delicious and my friend had an entree salad that was good, but visually looked like a large amount of lettuce with a chicken breast laid over the top. It was much less appealing than my pasta, and somewhat hard to eat, since there was so much lettuce on the plate.  Carmine’s is a lovely restaurant with a warm interior and a cozy patio that would perfect if the weather is nice.', 'Delicious lobster risotto and halibut special.  The caesar salar was also top notch.  Our server was attentive and knowledgable, helped me pick out a white wine to my tastes.  Appreciated the parking validation.  Prices are spendy but treat yourself, you deserve it.', \"We came to Carmine's to celebrate a birthday.  Everything was absolutely wonderful from the moment we walked into the restaurant.  The food was amazing, the service was tremendous and we will absolutely be back.\", 'First time visit. Enjoyed everything except the chlorinated table water.', 'Lovely setting across from the park in old Bellevue.  Professional staff, excellent service. Rigatoni bolognese was a nice touch over spaghetti. Ravioli with veal was excellent, in a rich veal Demi sauce. An added bonus is validated parking in the garage behind the restaurant.', \"Carmine's is an extraordinary restaurant, with exquisite food that's matched by its  outstanding service and ambiance. Highly, highly, highly recommend ... unless I need a reservation :)\", 'Waiter spilt a whole glass of water on me but somehow he turned it into a bonding experience and had a fantastically attentive experience to follow', 'Fabulous dinner with exquisite service !\\nThe birthday celebration was a complete success.', \"Birthday dinner was well recognized; the server was great; ambience was nice; there was free parking - but the food did not live up to expectations of a high-end restaurant.  Salad and wife's lobster risotto was good - in fact, risotto was very good.  Mushroom soup was pretty flat as was the veal ravioli - we expected more from this type of restaurant.\", 'We went there for an anniversary and the food was great, service was excellent and seemed to know when we needed something without interrupting us too much. They also gave us a small dessert with happy anniversary written in chocolate frosting that was a very nice and memorable touch. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very nice without the prices of such an atmosphere. Great Italian food.', 'Excellent as always! Service and food was fabulous.', \"Carmine's is a favorite for us.  Excellent food, impeccable service.  The only drawback is the noise level.  Last night the 4 of us had to almost shout to each other to be heard.  I will say, however, the place was crowded, so there you go.   Perhaps next time we'll request a table in the corner.\", 'Love it!  Always!  Never disappointed   Will always return.', 'They are famous for their gnocchi but ours was watery and not very good! We also had crab risotto which was so fishy we had to send it back. The salmon was amazing. Also, we all had Caesar salads and the dressing tasted more like watered down blue cheese  - there was no anchovy or traditional caesar flavor at all. Overall kind of a weird night taste wise for what is usually a stellar restaurant!', 'Everything is amazing from the food, to the service and the drinks, my new favorite place', 'I have always enjoyed my meal but tonight my chicken piccata was beyond salty, extremely dry and very disappointing.

Fun atmosphere, can't wait to go back.\", \"Great service, great food. Expensive and the noise level gets fairly high due to popularity/full dining room. I recommend if money and noise aren't deterrents to great food and service.\", 'Overall experience was great. Only issue was one dessert came after the other 3 were already done eating.', 'Favorite restaurant hands down.  Eat here all the time and always above and beyond expectations.  Food is so good!!!', 'Had a reservation for 2 for an anniversary dinner, and the service was wonderful and food was amazing!! The waitress, Ali, was super sweet and gave great suggestions for us. I asked for her suggestion between the gnocchi and rigatoni, and she recommended the rigatoni between the two. Ali suggested we split a large rigatoni into two smaller plates, with a small gnocchi too. As someone who doesn’t go to Italian restaurants often, nor do I know much about pasta, having those suggestions were so helpful! The rigatoni was delicious, and I highly recommend it for first-timers. The gnocchi was amazing as well, and it was really filling too. Even the small size would have me full on its own. We skipped appetizers, meats, and the pizza menu, but would love to try those next time. Since it was our anniversary, we received a complimentary dessert (tiramisu) at the end of the night and shared it between us two. The tiramisu was delicious, and even the chocolate sauce used for the writing was good too.\\n\\nAs for placing the reservation, I called to place a reservation at the patio, but didn’t receive a call back until about an hour or two later. I went ahead and reserved online instead, and once I got their call, we mentioned our online reservation and asked to be in the patio. The lady on the phone was very nice as well, and updated our reservation very quickly! \\n\\nDefinitely will come back another time! Such wonderful service and food, and the ambience is wonderful. The heaters kept us warm throughout the entire dinner, and the patio is extremely pretty at night. Thank you to the team at Carmine’s for a memorable anniversary dinner!', 'Food was mediocre. I had fairly high expectations going in but the best thing we had was the Caesar salad. Definitely skip the risotto, it was super bland', 'We loved the portions, atmosphere, menu and the amazing service with Michael.

Great ambiance with less unwanted noise than many other restaurants.', 'Heavenly experience.\\nI make it a point to go there often', 'Absolutely fantastic experience, food was superb and the waitress was excellent and attentive. Highly recommend a visit.', \"The foods was not impressed.  We ordered the new york steak, it was very thin and the waiter didn't ask how do we want it.  It turned out rough and dry.  The squid ink angel hair was nothing special, tomato sauce with seafoods.  The only highlight was the cream of mushroom soup.  The waiter was great, nice and clear.\", 'Incredible food, great service, very very loud! Couldn’t hear across the table.', 'One of my go to places ….another first class service experience', 'Love the experience every time at Carmine’s!

They surprised us with a birthday Tiramisu (which are also amazing).', 'Food was great, service was impeccable.\\nWas a little noisy', 'Food was below average for the price. The amount of seafood was much less than expected. The spaghetti was overcooked.', \"Eat lunch at Carmines often and love being in Daniel's section.  Daniel is highly professional and friendly.

I understand why reservations book fast.', 'Love it at Carmine’s so pretty and food is delicious!', \"I love everything about Carmines.  I can't say enough good things.\", 'The venue is small and the night we went it was very busy. It is not a quiet restaurant, but the energy is fantastic, the food is authentic and well prepared, and the service is outstanding. Everyone working there seemed to care about us and was proud of the restaurant. What a wonderful experience. The prices are very reasonable as well.', 'What a wonderful evening. Beautiful night in Bellevue. The food was incredible. And the staff so lovely to my dad for his birthday celebration. Big shout out to Julia the hostess and our waiter, Ryan. \\nThank you to all!', \"Carmine's is always a pleasure.  The food is outstanding (had the black pasta with seafood at lunch yesterday) and the service excellent.

People are always pleasant and welcoming; the food is always great.\", 'Wonderful lunch at Carmine’s this week with friends we haven’t seen since Covid began. Delicious halibut offering which we all opted for,  and enjoyed. The price point is high but service and food quality is well worth it.', 'Great food!  It lives up to its reputation.

Their tomato sauce is excellent. Flavors are wonderful.', \"What a lovely experience. Not only the food was amazing but Service was out of this world! We came here for a celebration and Carmine's made sure that we were celebrated with a beautiful table setup, dessert, and patio seating. Thank you especially Natalie for coordinating and Micheal for serving us\", 'Mista salad lettuce was soggy, steak was excellent', 'Clearly this is a 5 star restaurant.  All the food items were excellent including the bread. Service was top notch. Cappuccino was extremely delicious.  Cocktail was very good and wine by the glass a little pricey but not unreasonable.  The only miss was on the frozen chocolate mouse dessert.  We would not order it again.\\n\\nWhile we knew validated free parking was available, valet parking was a nice splurge.\\n\\nVibrant scene at the downtown Bellevue Park adds to the ambiance.', 'I do wish that they had music playing throughout the restaurant. I know sometimes they do but today they did not and although my husband and I had a good time, the ambience felt boring.', 'We loved it here - first time but definitely not the last.  Great food, great staff, beautiful decor, huge wine and spirit options.  Their specials were amazing as well.  The only two drawbacks: no sommelier and it was really loud inside the dining room - REALLY loud.  Won’t stop\\nus from returning - but we will probably going earlier and during the week instead.', 'Great evening! It was my birthday and we got complimentary deserts. Door excellent as always.', 'Carmines is a great place to take clients. very classy environment', \"We were celebrating our wedding anniversary & they were able to get us a table early since there was no room at the bar to sit & have a drink.  There was a nice 'Happy Anniversary' note on the table and our waiter was very knowledgable and friendly.  The food is always very good and of the highest quality.  This is our 'go to' for a nice dinner because the service is amazing and the food delicious.\", 'Always a wonderful experience.  Had the steak salad special for lunch and it was fantastic. I only wish I could have eaten their homemade bread but I am gluten free.  It smelled so good.  Umberto was our waiter and he timed our lunch perfectly.  Always at the top of my list when I visit Bellevue.', 'The BEST Italian on the Eastside!  Fresh and always delicious.', \"My birthday dinner at Carmine's was amazing! Everyone made us feel welcomed, and multiple people wished me a happy birthday. The ambiance was perfect, the food was delicious, and our server Ali was amazing! Probably one of my favorite servers I've ever had. I also highly recommend the tiramisu. We were only visiting the area but if we lived there we would definitely be back to see Ali and to have more delicious Italian food!\", 'We had a fabulous birthday celebration for our daughter. Carmines allowed us to add a 5th guest to our reservation at the last minute. Our server was excellent, and the food & drinks and desserts were awesome.', \"We reserved ahead of time and specified that it was a special occassion when making the reservation. When we arrived, they had a table waiting for us. Unfortunately, it was smack dab in the middle of a very busy walkway with people knocking into it every time they passed. Knowing that it was a special occassion, I think Carmine's could have given us a better table, so that was annoying. Thankfully, when we complained, they did seat us at another table and the waitress completely made up for our bad first impression. She provided wonderful service, helped us select a great bottle of wine and made jokes with our teenagers. The food was delicious and we ended up having a really enjoyable dinner.\", 'Wonderful place, tasty food , nice location . Really recommend this place', \"Great service. Daniel was exceptional.\\n\\nOnly con was no TP in women's bathroom…\", 'I wanted to take my girls out for a classy, authentic Italian dinner, and I thought this place would be great for that, but it wasn\\'t. Although the decor is nice, it gives off the ambiance of a Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of how loud it is, and that was a big turn-off to me. We went on a Wednesday night, so I can’t even imagine what it\\'s like on Friday or Saturday.  Our waiter was a jerk, to put it nicely, he was more concerned with the larger table, probably assuming the tip would be better, he barely checked on us and when I asked a question he spoke to me a condescending and disrespectful manner. It\\'s expensive, and I expected that. However, you’re essentially forced to buy a bottle of wine if you want a glass because they charge $25-30 for 1 glass of wine, which is ridiculous. The bottles of wine are outrageously overpriced, and when I asked what the house wine was, the waiter sarcastically responded, \"There\\'s no such thing.\" I\\'ve been to more expensive restaurants than this one, and even they sell a reasonably priced house wine. The food was a step up from Olive Garden, nothing spectacular.  The manager did come over and make it right in the end, but honestly, the night was already ruined at that point. Definitely will never return to this restaurant.', 'First visit here, and we would highly recommend.\\nFrom the moment we walked in the door, the bar and our dinner table we were taken care of.\\nWonderful experience and dinner was delicious!\\n\\nWe will definitely come back!', 'We came to celebrate my husbands birthday on Tuesday night.  \\nThe food was delicious. \\nThe waiter was very professional. \\nThe warm fresh bread kept coming as our 15 year old son was very hungry. \\n\\nCons: \\nVery very loud. \\nNot a lot of room between tables \\nNot enough servers/ waiters between the tables.', 'I would not recommend going for lunch unless you are walking.  It was stated on my reminder from Open Table that their is a valet for $5 OR parking in their building.  Neither was available.  The restaurant said that they no longer offer parking for lunch & according to my guest she said that the reason I could not get into the garage is probably because it was full.  Their was only one space when she got it & there could not have been more than 10 spaces available for the retail.', 'We had a wonderful meal at Carmine’s, but it was so noisy that our table of 4 had a hard time  talking to each other. An outdoor table might have been a better choice!', 'Food was very good and service excellent.  It was really warm yesterday and the restaurant became quite toasty so took away a bit from the ambience and experience.', \"Long time patrons back to the 90's in Seattle.

I was contacted by management and they were super apologetic and appreciative of the feedback.

We booked a table for our daughters bday next month and can’t wait. Thank Carmines for continuing to be our favorite spot in Bellevue. AMBIANCE AND SERVICE 5 STAR!!Carmines is our go to but this visit wasn’t great. We had friends in town and were excited to bring them but we were hugely disappointed with the service this time. We were at a table over by the bathrooms and it was like they forgot about us. We weren’t even sure who our waiter was.  Embarrassing after we talked up how great Carmine’s is. We have a reservation in a few days for a birthday celebration and I’m hoping it’s not as disappointing as this visit was.', 'Hard to find a restaurant that excels at everything but Carmines definitely does it.', 'Most of the food was very good. Halibut was disappointing. It did not seem fresh. Not flaky or tasty.\\nKat was great waiter. Outdoor seating is very pleasant.', 'Love food and the ambience at Carmine’s but service was not great this time. Disappointing as we had family visiting us and the experience just didn’t live up to our expectations.', 'Amazing experience at this beautiful, professional, welcoming and all around happy establishment.

Whether a daytime lunch or evening out, Carmine’s does not disappoint.', 'I am a frequent customer. I enjoy lunch here with antipasto, sometimes a chef pizza, chioppino, and an espresso following the meal. Other of my favorites are the veal scallopini, osso bucco, and pastas. Table linens, fabric napkins, plate service, nice glasses for drinks, clean bathrooms, all help make it feel like an excellent value. It is also a great location next to the Bellevue Park for a walk after the meal.', 'We live in the neighborhood, and bring along our older Labrador, Bleu, to enjoy the patio with us.  He just loves to watch the movement and enjoy his special water he receives from the staff.  The food, service, wine list, cocktails are alway excellent and on point.

A must visit when in the Bellevue area.', 'No one in my party had dined here prior including myself. What a great find this was.

It feels like a special place to be. The indoor/outdoor flow is really nice. It is very open and airy inside. The service here is very good. Lots of attention to detail. The food is solid. I wouldn't say it's outstanding, but for the volume that they are doing, it is really good. I've eaten good things here before, but this time I didn't like what I ordered at all. A filet mignon salad. It was the special and it had both blue cheese and radicchio in it, making it super bitter and almost inedible. My daughter and mother-in-law liked their halibut and cannelloni very much. Overall, really nice restaurant to celebrate or just have a nice meal.\", 'Wonderful food, wine, and cocktails.

Whether you are there for a special occasion or dinner with friends, your dinner is exceptional.\", 'My recent anniversary celebration at Carmine’s was a disappointing experience.\\nFirst and foremost, despite making an reservation and mentioning our anniversary, we were assigned a table that was located right next to the corner of a busy street during the rush hour. The noise from passing cars, pedestrians, and the smell of gas made it impossible to enjoy my meal. When I requested a different table, the host said all tables are reserved and this table has more privacy. Seriously???? There were plenty of empty tables throughout our entire dinner, which made the seating situation even more frustrating.\\nThe quality of the food was underwhelming. It appeared as though I was served leftovers rather than freshly prepared dishes. The bread was hard and dry. A lot of online reviews had praised complimentary anniversary or birthday dessert, but we left without any such dessert. Honestly, based on my experience, I can’t recommend this overrated & overpriced restaurant to anyone.', 'Loved the food, atmosphere and service.  Great experience!  Thank you!', \"Always a delightful experience. The service, food, and atmosphere are top-notch.

It was my husband’s birthday so they brought us a tiramisu but never asked us if we wanted dessert. Our waiter spent more time with the table next to us and he seemed to give them full service vs giving us limited service. Maybe he was trying to get rid of us early? \\n\\nOverall a mediocre experience. This is my third time at the restaurant and second so-so food experience and my first bad service experience.

Loved the gnocchi and veggies it came with too.

The bar drink (Gunsmoke Manhattan) was great, the wines by the glass to follow excellent with our meals.  The sautéed spinach is a tour de force every time, the warm bread and butter a guilty pleasure.  We split “cups” of the minestrone soup which is portioned like a bowl and tastes like it was delivered from a fresh vegetable garden.  The venison ravioli with spinach and mushrooms was outstanding.

Both my boyfriend and I have worked in high demanding customer service jobs before so we understand how things can get. However, we had to wait 15 minutes after we finished our drinks to even order a second round and our bread never came as well. We love dining here and have always been super happy with our experience but this time around we were left feeling very dissapointed.', 'Disappointing. Poor quality of cooking.\\n\\nThe Calamari fritti was very oily, mushy and not crunchy at all because the cook didn’t fry them right. My husband and I felt sick right after eating the calamari. (We don’t have allergies to seafood. We are both calamari fritti lovers.)\\n\\nPoor presentation on dishes. They didn’t put any herbs on my fish. Here is NOT another cheap eatery.\\n\\nPasta with bolognese sauce. They didn’t bring cheese and a grater, so WE ASKED them to grate cheese on it.\\n\\nWe felt like there was the absence of any chefs for our table. I don’t think it’s good value for the price.', 'We had a chance to celebrate our Anniversary here and everything was perfect!

Thanks for an awesome dinner!', 'A perfect evening✨', 'Honestly, for having made a reservation in advanced for our anniversary, I was disappointed to be sat in the middle of a ton of commotion, and honestly while the food was decent, for the price I had higher expectations. I wouldn’t recommend this place, which is unfortunate because it seems as though it could be a promising atmosphere.', 'The main problem with this restaurant is that it is simply not a place to go to have a nice relaxing meal.  The tables are packed together but the main problem is the extraordinarily high noise level.  We were a table of 4 and most of the time could not hear what each other was saying.  The waiter could barely hear the order.  People at other tables were all similarly yelling to be heard.  The restaurant has many hard surfaces and could easily improve the sound situation by adding some sound absorbing materials as many other restaurants do.  The food is quite good and the service professional but there are many other more relaxing options for Italian food.', 'Excellent food, atmosphere, and staff.  Britney was great!', 'Very enjoyable experience, The food taste, quality and quantity were excellent accompanied with outstanding service.  Tables comfortably spaced giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy both their meals and company. Fully occupied for a Saturday evening dinner creating a moderate but comfortable noise level.

Extensive wine menu but with unreasonably high prices compared to comparable restaurants in the area.', 'It was fabulous!!!!!', 'Celebrating our 46th Anniversary', 'Service was very attentive.  Veal scallopini and veal chop were well prepared.  The Caesar dressing was tasty. Valet parking appreciated.', 'A wonderful evening.  A lovely setting.  Carmines is nestled within a lovely tree lined neighborhood adjacent to Bellevue Park.  Our server Bethany was excellent, very personable and attentive.  The food was excellent.

Will happily return.', 'A great place to take someone who you are trying to treat. Loved their spumoni ice-cream and bread.', 'I was there with a friend for my birthday. The food was nice and the service was superb, definitely recommend!', 'Very good food with the exception of a limpid Caesar salad.

Excellent service, delicious food, the best Lemon Drop ever.  Definitely a return visit is in the cards.', 'Carmine’s never disappoints!', 'Great, as always!', \"Great attention to details!  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted in a respectful and friendly manner.  We got an awesome table near the patio door so the wind was able to blow through during the warm evening.  The wine list was extensive and somewhat intimidating if you didn't know your Italian wines.  Our server, Sossity, was very helpful in choosing a wine based on our preferences, but not an overly pricey choice.  All the food was amazing!

The sever was super nice and very attentive.  The food was delicious.', 'a most wonderful chicken salad and Jesse was terrific. four of us celebrate each of our birthdays here', 'Wine was tasty food was really good and the service was nice. The only reason they didn’t get a five star is because the server forgot about us and we had only had bread and water for the first 30 minutes. We had a late reservation and the restaurant was cleaning up for the night so it’s not a big deal. I would have rated 4.5 stars if possible.', \"The food is wonderful and the service impeccable. I especially like to eat al fresco. It's so pretty outside! One comment: way too much salad dressing!

Wish it was a little quieter but we did sit near the kitchen.', 'For starters we ordered the Burrata with vegetables, it was okay. \\nThe Calamari Fritti was delish, would definitely recommend that as a starter. \\nFor mains we ordered the meat special of the day, Porter House. The steak was good, the mushroom vinaigrette sauce a little too sweet for me. We also ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese which is very delightful.', \"We always enjoy Carmine's.  My only complaint over the years is that the cushions on the dining chairs are two soft.  They seem to be sinking with age and need to be replaced!\", 'Food was excellent, generous portions, attentive and engaging wait staff.

Highly recommend the Carmine's dining experience.\", 'Alwaya fabulous service and food.', 'This was a great place for any occasion.

Can’t wait for our next visit! \\n\\nThank you for making our anniversary so special!', 'Great visit Saturday evening.  Food was really good and the service was prompt and friendly.  I took off one star for service as I feel we were misled on both an entree order and a glass of wine.  For the entree issue, my friend could not decide between 2 dishes so the waiter said he would give her half of each.  She was charged for 2 small portions instead, which came out around $7 more than getting just a large.  We did not complain as she did get 2 smalls and paid for 2 smalls, but that was not the assumption.  The wine issue… a friend wanted a good Italian wine and the waiter said he would get her something good.  So he picked the highest priced glass of barolo.  I think if she knew the price she would not have ordered that, but he did not give her any choice.  Again, she got what she paid for, so no issue with that, it’s just kind of an underhanded upsell.  Still would highly recommend the restaurant, just be clear what you want to order and what you’ll pay.  Several visits here and this was the first issue we had, so you should be fine.', 'One of the best Italian restaurants I’ve been to!!', 'Great calamari and service.', 'Amazing food and service.  carmine’s does not disappoint!  My go to for a long leisurely lunch with my bestie.  We had calamari which was delicious and tender. Lovely ceasar salad, perfectly dressed. And lovely fresh pasta….to die for.

All in all, a great place to go and repeat going!', 'Celebrated an anniversary at Carmines.

Our server was top notch, anticipating our needs and very attentive given the busy dinner hour. Made reservations well in advance. Enjoyed a great bruschetta to share for 4 of us with plenty to go around—the salmon was the best on this trio. No complaints from us on our salads and entrees—halibut special was piccata style and beautifully presented. Coolked to perfection. Loved the bread pudding for the grand finale. Hope to be back soon.', 'We were really looking forward to celebrating my husband’s birthday here. We have been here a few times and really enjoyed it and the service was always on point but unfortunately this time was a let down. In the past they have had a cute happy birthday card but maybe that’s not a thing anymore. Server was nice but was missing most of the time and didn’t come over often. Our plates were being cleared in a rush before we were done with our appetizer. We didn’t even bother staying for dessert this time. Overall the food was good but the experience for the price wasn’t worth it.', \"Beautiful setting outside with outstanding meal.  Our table had appetizers, hot and cold entrees and all were served at the right temperature with no shortcuts for lunch selections.  Always dependable - one of my favorite go-to's!\", 'Best food and service.  Thank you', 'Again my wife and I greatly enjoyed each item we ordered. We will continue to visit for special occasions.

Lemon meringue dessert was fabulous!', \"We are regular patrons of Carmine's because the food is always  very good.  This time the lunch entrees were mediocre.

Some of the best Italian food I have had outside of Italy.', 'The woman who greeted us and sat us at our table was below what we expected. She would not smile and appeared stressed or she didn\\'t want to be there. I asked her if she had a good day, and all I got was \"it was ok\". For the amount of money that we spent on our fabulous dinner, I was shocked to get such a cold shoulder from someone who sat us for our 23rd wedding anniversary. It just set the mood wrong for the rest of the dinner.\\nBut our waiter was fantastic and food was beyond our expectations. Fried Calamari, Rack of Lamb and Oso Bucco were by far the best we have ever had! We will be back!', 'This place is very noisy. Carmines downtown  has a much quieter ambiance. Makes for better experience. They could put up something for sound attenuation which would make it more pleasant.', \"After checking the menu, we asked about the soup, risotto, and fish specials.

It is now the equal to Il Terazzo Carmine in Seattle (owned and operated by Carmine) father of the boys who now run Carmines.

Only thing I didn’t love is that we were crammed into a tiny table that seemed like an afterthought in the dining room and it kept getting jostled by people walking by', 'Carmine\\'s Bellevue is awesome - I highly recommend it.

Thank you to the entire family at Carmines!', \"Came to celebrate a birthday.   Place was popping so very loud, could barely hear our waiter.  We ordered an appetizer but that was apparently skipped over.  Two croutons on salad?  Weird.  Filet was poorly seasoned, almost bland.  Cioppino was bland as well.   Shrimp was overcooked and not edible.   Second time dining here and service and food hasn't changed since the last time I visited.  Definitely not worth the price tag.\", 'The dining experience was excellent. For us, the noise level, though energetic, was quite loud making conversation difficult.', 'My girlfriend and I went to Carmine’s for our anniversary. It was the best experience.

Service always impeccable!  Food always delicious!  Even though I live in Seattle, the trek to Bellevue is always  worth it knowing the destination is Carmine’s!', 'It is hard to fully capture the ambiance of Carmines in words. I think the best way I can do it justice is saying there is charisma in the air. Everything is white linen. There is laughter and a level of joy in the air. Everyone who works here feels less like staff and more like family. There is a genuine and warm smile on the bartender, Kelen. There is an unparalleled wine knowledge and kind demeanor from the wine director, Alfredo. And the boss, Adrian, comes by to make sure you are doing ok and can make anything happen for you. Even waiters from previous visits remember you. Paulo is the kindest man I have ever met. I eat out a lot at a lot of high end restaurants every day. Carmines is one of the few restaurants I would still describe as an experience. At the end of the day, it continues to be the best on a consistent basis over anywhere else. I highly recommend the crispy calamari for an appetizer. The duck has the best cherry sauce on it I have ever tasted. For dessert I like the tiramisu! Drink wise they have a huge wine selection. For a cocktail I love the ananas. It is Titos that has been infused in pineapples for 30 days straight. Then it is shaken in a cocktail shaker and poured out for you. Amazing!', 'Fantastic, The best Italian restaurant in Bellevue WA.', 'Consistently great food & service. Very busy lunch rush, but everything was great!', 'I am never disappointed when I visit Carmines in Bellevue.

My husband has the prime beef tenderloin with gnocchi and the beef was superb, better than the steak restaurants, but the gnocchi and green beans were over-cooked. Gnocchi was mushy so we didn't eat those and the green beans were soft and not crunchy.

We were just about ready to leave but it was not what I would have expected at Carmine’s', 'Love it always.', 'It was quiet at first then got noisier as the night wore on. Very attentive service, nice ambience, great drinks and deliciously prepared food. Definitely will be back next time we are in the area.', 'I’ve been here 3 times in the last month. By far some of the best service I’ve received in Bellevue. All 3 times I had incredible servers/bartenders, who you can tell love what they do. They were incredibly kind, honestly hilarious and truly cared about your experience. The espresso martinis are incredible, their pasta is great, and their spinach ricotta stuffed chicken was sooo good! They have a lemon dessert that literally melts in your mouth, the freshest lemon taste honestly. They also have a bread pudding that has chocolate chips instead of raisins (who likes raisins?) so that made me happy! Come here.', \"Took my grandma out to Carmines for her birthday. We loved it. We arrived at 5pm right when it opened so it was still quiet and only later did it get more noisy. The service was amazing. We were served by a kind blonde woman who was very good at what she does.

It is the first week that the pandemic mask mandate has been lifted and may have explained why every table was full.  The tables were very close to each other, and it was very difficult to have a conversation due to the noise of a full, busy restaurant.

We ordered the mushroom risotto and shrimp pesto pasta, they were both excellent!  The panzanella salad was ok, I think they forgot dressing and not much bread. We had to ask for a basket of bread and for drink refills.  We felt like we were an afterthought.  Maybe they were setting up for dinner?  The service definitely wasn’t the best that I have had. Disappointed!', 'I brought a good friend of mine to the restaurant for her birthday lunch.  Unfortunately she had ordered the clams with Linguine meal and it had sand in the clams, which she realized as she took her first bite of her meal.  I felt bad, but do realize that sometimes this type of thing to happen, but I was sorry it happened to the birthday girl!  She then ordered the Eggplant Parmesan which she enjoyed very much.

Thought is was a bit too noisy.', 'Forgot my shrimp first time ever but always great!', 'Per usual, this place never disappoints!', \"Carmine's food and service make for a great experience. Coming from the east coast I more than appreciate a good Italian meal. Carmine's does not disappoint in that regard. The Eggplant Parm as an appetizer is about as good as it gets. Last night I had the Osso Bucco which is one of the many fine choices on the menu. Have a nice bottle of wine with your meal and when you get the check, you at least feel the meal was was the price. As an fyi, the liquor as in most restaurants is what jacks the price up but this is a business so expect the added expense.\", 'Always fantastic love \\nthe ambience especially in the bar \\nfood can’t be beat and of course the company was stellar❗️', 'Celebrated anniversary in great style.

Our seating, with reservation well in advance, was disappointing. There were seven of us; 5 seniors. We were seated on a a long booth with tables pushed together. Made it very difficult for those seated on the booth section to exit/enter the space.  Plus the large cushions on the corner added to the challenge. For this size party, booking so far in advance, a free standing table would have been  much better. Plus near the kitchen so pretty loud for the first hour or so.', 'Always awake', \"Carmine's has been the quintessential go to spot for fine Italian dinning for decades starting in Seattle.

And the tiramisu was perfect!', 'Excellent food, service and ambience.  Never disappoints.  Great place to celebrate special occasions.', 'Excellent covered patio area with heaters for outdoor dining.', 'Food is usually spot on here. The pesto pasta amazing as usual. The lamb was tough and not seasoned enough. By the time our server checked on us my partner finished his food because he was starving. I left 80% of the lamb on the plate because it was not the quality I expected. I don’t know if it was the lamb or the cook but it’s made me question ordering the non-pasta items there.', 'The salmon and pizza were excellent, the tenderloin was just okay for the price, especially when there are a dozen excellent steak restaurants in the area. It is indeed super loud in the restaurant. The patio looked adorable and cozy but was filled. The waiter had a bit of an attitude when the steak needed to be sent back as we ordered it between medium and medium-rare and it was literally almost raw. He did bring it back with an extra portion of sides so that was nice. The people at the front and who I think were the owners/managers were exceptionally friendly and grateful.', \"Best restaurant in Bellevue, hands down. But they weren't checking vaccine cards which was very concerning.\", 'Excellent food and services!', \"I've been to Carmines before but this last visit was very disappointing. The service was incredibly slow and somewhat rude. When we first sat down and ordered our drinks (wine), we received one glass that wasn't what we ordered. It was an $18 glass of wine. When we said we didn't like it, we were just told that that's what they have. We didn't even feel like we could order a different glass. Then during the meal, we were never asked if we wanted more drinks. Also, our food sat on the table for at least 20 minutes before anybody came and took it or bagged it to go. Then the Birthday dessert came before we were even offered the opportunity to order other desserts for the table. When we did order more, the waiter looked annoyed and told us what we wanted could take 20 minutes so maybe order something different. It almost felt like we were being ignored a little bit. Not great for what you pay to go there. Also, it is incredibly loud in the restaurant.\", 'Everything was great except the driving rain outside.', 'We had a FANTASTIC dinner at Carmine’s.

We had a good time and the food was delicious, especially the desserts.', 'I absolutely love this restaurant. It is a bit pricey, but I think that it is worth it for the quality of food.

All the staff are always very nice and attentive, and have great recommendations.', 'Better seating next time would be great.', 'The food here is amazing! The preparation and flavor of each dish is unique, mouthwatering and delicious. We love dining here and look forward to our next visit.', \"Shame on Carmine's !  Did not check for proof of COVID 19 vaccination as they are required to do by law. Tables very close together. Noise level unpleasant.   Food is average northern Italian fare ... very little finesse to the presentation.  Service was poor.  Long wait to get any attention  to start our ordering,  Waiter was rather abrupt,  impatient.  Restaurant was very busy ... seems to be a gold mine so perhaps they don't think they need to try very hard to provide an enjoyable dining experience or be COVID compliant.\", 'Always excellent at Carmine’s. We went for a friend’s birthday. Everything was perfect and our waiter was wonderful…a treat you don’t always get in Seattle so it feels that much more special.', 'It’s always consistently good food great service love it there', 'Excellent food & service.   Would certainly recommend as a top-tier Italian restaurant.', 'Great place for special event, attention to detail by everyone.', \"world's loudest ppl sat next to us, was so annoying since i could hear nothing\", 'I was very excited to to try this restaurant. I read reviews and based on how difficult it was to get reservation I thought this place would blow me away. Oh I was so wrong. I do want to point out the service was good but what disappointed was the food. For the appetizer we got sautéed calamari which was good but nothing that I would rave about. For entree I ordered a duck breast and that is when the meal went wrong. I asked for medium prepared  and what I got is a raw piece of duck breast which tasted like raw meat and was so chewy. Of course my husband told the waiter about  it and they tried to fix it by overcooking the duck to the point it had no juices left and tasted dry and flavorless. It was very disappointing. I couldn’t eat it. And of course they charged me for this expensive entree that I couldn’t eat. To try to make us feel better they didn’t charge us for a desert my husband and I shared. Overall it was a disappointing experience for us.', 'Gnocchi falls apart in your mouth! So delicious !!

The food order took a bit too long to come (~30-40 mins).', 'The Panzanella salad with chicken I ordered for lunch was underwhelming with roughly two ounces of chicken, hardly any bread or tomatoes. No basil,  loads upon loads of romaine. I would not order it again. That said, the Capresse Salad for start was excellent, but would be improved with sea salt. Tiramisu was delicious for dessert, but coffee was very disappointing (overly roasted and lukewarm) for such a visually lovely atmosphere.', 'Amazing food and great service!!!', 'Our second visit.

I was having lunch with my sister and debated over the daily special Chilean Sea Bass in an awesome butter sauce with linguine on the side OR the menu offers linguine with fresh Manila Clams which I love.  The special won out.  My sister enjoyed her Eggplant baked with tomato sauce and mozzarella.  \\n\\nService was fun.  They took good care of us.  We were both celebrating our birthdays and they surprised us by serving each of us a delicious tiramisu, happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate, and a birthday candle so we could each make a wish.

We can always count on great food and service.\", 'I absolutely don’t understand the fascination with Carmines. The ambiance and location are great, but that’s about it. The service is dreadfully slow, the food just mediocre, and the price very high. My partner had osso bucco and it wasn’t cooked long enough to be tender. I had the bolognese and it legitimately tasted like chef boyardee from my childhood. The bread was good and the Caprese starter too, but short of those items we left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. We likely won’t be back.', 'We were so pleased with the service. We were late due to our poor planning, they were so nice to accommodate us with the same table as we reserved. Our waitress who only works on Monday, was wonderful.  This was such a contrast to the night before at Ascend where we were just a number, our evening ruined by a manager.  We have patronized the Seattle location for years, it is nice to see how customer service has continued at this location.

My reservation was for 5, but we showed up with 6, and they quickly accommodated us with a table. We brought wine and Rose which they chilled quickly and served them all.

Highly recommend!', 'Carmines has quickly been the finest place to go to post-covid. The ambiance can only be described as exquisite. I eat out… way too much… and there is just something at Carmines that leaves you with an air of enchantment. The manager, Adrian is the most amazing person you will ever meet! He is the kind of guy that turns a normal day into a special occasion. He makes Carmines go from great to my favorite! Last night I had the good fortune of Coco being our waitress and I felt like we were best friends by the end of the night. She was absolutely phenomenal and treated my friend and I like we were family.  Food wise, if you like duck I highly recommend the duck. It is a delight to the senses with its slight bourbon cherry sauce coating. My second favorite is the filet mignon with gnocchi. I don’t even normally get filets but this one is out of this world. The pine nuts on the top give it a slight crunch that pairs perfectly with the steak. If you are looking for pasta I recommend the gnocchi in brown butter, it is to die for. In terms of drinks you need to try their ananas. It is Titos infused with fresh pineapples for an entire month. There is no vodka flavor, only a refreshing relish of pineapple. If you like mezcal, the mezcal sour is also a joy to the senses! The wine selection is also out of this world. I constantly get a different bottle and am always amazed with the diversity of fantastic wines they have! For dessert my two favorites are the semifreddo (mostly frozen, very rich chocolate) and spumoni ice cream (which has those amazing bourbon cherries on top). This has quickly become my favorite restaurant and I am here far more often than I should admit! I hope you love this place as much as I do!', 'Yummy food, great service!

My husband loved his spaghetti --which is high praise  from a man who loves his pasta, and had the proverbial Italian mother who knew how to cook the old fashioned  way.

So, when I made early 5pm reservations on Open Table, I wrote “In the bar, please!”  I got the two normal confirmation texts/emails.  And, as requested, we were seated in the bar.  We ordered cocktails, appetizers, wine, salads, and our main courses. Then, at around 7 pm, when our waiter delivered our dessert/after-dinner-drink menus, he apologized saying the hostess had promised our table to another group and they had been waiting for a half hour.  So we would need to be moved up to the bar stools.  With four of us, that made it all weird; so we and our guests just decided to give our waiter a great tip and leave.  On the way out, I asked what happened and the manager said we had made our bar-table request on Open Table and the others had “called it in,” so they had priority.  He offered us a gift certificate but we really didn’t want it. At this point, I’m not sure whether we will go back to Carmine’s despite their great food.', 'Best Italian cuisine and dining experience in all of Seattle/Bellevue.

Beautiful restaurant with great service and delicious food. Only hiccup was that we choose one of the special entrees, the sea bass and were shocked at the $45 price tag. Very expensive lunch. I guess it’s tricky to rattle off the specials without mentioning prices. Seems a bit tacky to do so but then again, getting charged so much for one dish unexpectedly is a hit.', \"My husband and I tried it out on Valentine's Day and it was fabulous.

Great atmosphere and service.', 'Carmine’s has been my go to restaurant for lunches, date night and girls night out from its opening.  It’s a beautiful restaurant and the service a usually ok. Unfortunately, over the past couple years with the increase of the number of guest dinning the quality of the food has suffered. You can expect for the fish to be over cooked and the beautiful squid ink past to be almost the texture of mashed potatoes. The Risotto looks and taste like a big glob of overCooked rice. So disappointed, thankfully Bellevue has new restaurants popping up everyday.', 'The service and the food were at the top end of amazing. We will be back!', 'Best dining experience in Bellevue!', \"Always wonderful to eat at Carmine's Bellevue as well as Flagship Restaurant Il Terrazzo Carmine in Pioneer Square, Seattle.

For lunch, that is too long.', 'Food took a little it was busy so understandable but the food was so very much worth the wait.  I recommend three herb crusted rack of lamb.', \"First time visiting Carmine's and have heard nothing but good things. Overall the experience was good, not great. Unfortunately the restaurant was VERY loud. Of course we expected this going in on a busy Saturday night but as a group of 4 we found it very hard to hold conversation as we all had to keep leaning into the table to hear each other. It also made it challenging to order and interact with the servers. This can't really be controlled by the restaurant but perhaps there are additional ways they could look to improve the acoustics in the space? Not really sure. My only other issue was the steak I had was over-seasoned and came out extremely salty. I powered through it because I generally like salty foods but even this was over the top for me so I only ate about half of it. The rest of the food I had, and my friends had, was fantastic. Probably was just a one time miss I am guessing. I would recommend others to go to Carmine's and I will give it another shot for sure.\", 'Everything was perfect 👌🏽', 'Absolutely fantastic experience', 'Placed a reservation for the 2 of us for our 20th anniversary lunch.  We were seated in the bar facing the tv.  Bar had a few tables and the server was the bartender.

We all agreed that we will be returning.', 'Great food, impeccable service...never disappoints!', 'We were celebrating my husband’s birthday and had indicated this on our reservation. We were seated next to a family with two very small kids. One child would crawl across his Mom on the bench seat that my husband was seated on. The kid was trying to get our attention and was crawling very close to our table and to my husband. Like within a few inches as table spacing was tight. Really distracting, frustrating and frankly not what I expect or hope for in a higher end dining experience. Food was ok. My pork was really dry. They quickly offered to redo it so the server tried hard. Nonetheless I left feeling like I way overpaid given the very poor ambiance and the food quality. Disappointed.', 'Highest quality food I have had in any restaurant.  I have traveled all of Europe, Caribbean  and most of the US.  Staff willing to ensure our visit was as expected.', 'Had a great time celebrating birthdays and getting family together! Wonderful evening!!!', 'Staff is fabulous! i would recommend for special occasion', 'It was very enjoyable. I have been here many times and I like it very much. I can’t go five stars because there are Italian places I enjoy more but you cannot go wrong. Excellent service, great quiet environment, and it is very comfortable. The cannelloni is very good.', \"This was the first time at Carmine's Bellevue.  I have dined in their flagship restaurant Il Terrazzo Carmine in Pioneer Square, Seattle many times.  Carmine's Bellevue is absolutely beautiful looking out onto the Bellevue City Park, a 21-acre oasis of green in the heart of Bellevue so the view is beautiful and restful.  The menu is typically Italian and well crafted.  They have valet parking to make it a treat to visit at any time.\", 'The salad I ordered was almost all cheese and no dressing. Very blah. Not much take and chicken was dry. Cauliflower soup was very good, but very rich.', 'There was a large group of loud and seemingly drunk people behind us which took away from the date night we were trying to have. Otherwise it was an excellent experience with amazing food and wine.', 'Food was amazing.  Highly recommend the bruschetta trio.  My friend and I both sound not stop raving about the bread; I do not know if it is made in house or not, but the bread was fresh and flavorful.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pesto and prawn fettuccini.  It struck the perfect balance--flavorful but not too salty, creamy but not heavy.  She enjoyed her cannelloni, which she said tasted authentic.  We were so stuffed that we did not make it to dessert.  However, we already decided halfway through our meal that we would have to go back with our family and friends.  We were celebrating her birthday.  The restaurant was fancier than expected, so I could see it being perfect for special occasions.  It is also spacious.  We went for lunch, so it was relatively quiet.  However, I imagine that it could get loud if the restaurant was full of diners.  Friendly and professional service.  Highly recommend the restaurant.  Cannot wait to go back.', 'The best food and service! We had a great time', 'Great service and food.  Love the decor.

Wonderful evening, as usual.', \"Maybe because it was New Year's eve the food was pre-prepared? The food that came out was not piping hot and looked like it was sitting for awhile.

Yay! \\nOur orders were delicious. Even gluten free pasta had texture and not mushy. My ossobuco was very flavorful and the bone marrow was fantastic! Alfredo small portion was a lot!

The soup of the day (cream of asparagus) was bland and the texture uneven.  My wife’s cannelloni was disappointing as was my fettuccine with prawns.  On the positive side, the bread and spumoni were excellent and the service outstanding; all service people were unobtrusive but very attentive to our needs without being asked.', 'Best restaurant in Bellevue!', \"We attending with two young girls, ages 5 & 8.

They made my birthday and anniversary fantastic and so special!!

It’s been my favorite restaurant in Bellevue for a while now and for good reason. The ambiance is posh, food is delicious, and the service is really special. This time around I tried a few different items on the menu. For appetizers I strongly suggest the eggplant parmesan! The beef tartare was also quite delicious! For main courses the osso buco, duck breast, halibut, fileto con gnocchi, and ribeye are my personal favorites! I asked for my ribeye to be medium-rare and it came out perfectly! It melted in my mouth. If you are a fan of osso buco this is the best osso buco I’ve ever had. The halibut is soft and flaky! For dessert they have the best spumoni ice cream, tiramisu, semifreddo, and profiteroles. I tried the profiteroles for the first time yesterday and I was blown away. They have this rich melted chocolate on top of them and they looked gorgeous. For Washington wine I suggest the quilceda creek, Cayuse, or D2. For Italian wine I really liked the Vigorello. I’m terms of white French white wine I was really impressed with the christophe pichon condrieu. They also have a Vueve Rose which is delicious!

We ordered extra gluten free pasta and squid ink pasta. It was all delicious and flavorful. Oh! The bread was awesome ! Crispy crust and chewy flavorful texture. Best bread EVER! \\nBrett was a very great waiter that served us. He was pleasant, patient and humerous. Our overall experience at Carmine’s was WAYYYYYYY better than Ascend Prime steak. It felt genuine at Carmine’s. Interior is classy as well as the patio going into the restaurant. It’s well kept and clean. We will return', 'LOVE Carmine’s. This night, the restaurant was packed and we were seated next to a very large', 'Amazing food and excellent service. Just a little difficult to hear each other talk across the table.', 'I had an amazing luncheon with the best friend, the food was amazing, the atmosphere was lovely & the staff were so friendly and helpful. Can’t wait to go back !!!!', 'Such a lovely experience and felt so valued and cared for. Food was amazing and staff was excellent!', 'Great food, decent portions, attentive wait staff.', 'Great place for our 10 year Anniversary dinner!', 'Fantastic experience. Food wonderful, atmosphere fantastic but best of all the staff were amazing. From the kitchen staff to our server. They made a memorable night more memorable. Great job. Highly recommend.', 'Absolutely wonderful!', \"I am a regular here, but this was my sister's first time in. She really enjoyed the atmosphere, and said that  the restaurant is beautiful. Food was great as always and our server was energetic, friendly, and knowledgeable.\", 'This is a big noisy restaurant. I just got back from Italy and the food at Carmine’s does not compare', 'First time visit, very competent staff & chef, lots of gluten-free options. No bad dishes, always a good sign. Halibut special was amazing. Even the panna-cotta was excellent. Relaxed ambience. Will be back!', 'Celebrating a big birthday was treated as a very special occasion, and we loved it!  The complimentary dessert was amazing!', 'I took a friend to Carmine\\'s for her birthday and there was a little birthday note on the table when we arrived, and they brought out a chocolate mousse with a chocolate \"Happy Birthday\" drizzle on the plate - so very thoughtful and appreciated!  We both ordered a side caesar salad and never wanted it to end - so good!!  She had the halibut special and I had gnocchi with brown butter - she loved her halibut and my gnocchi was fluffy and so delicious.  Oh, and I wanted to eat the entire basket of bread...just enough crust on the outside and softness on the inside.  Carmine\\'s isn\\'t cheap but not prohibitively expensive either - just a wonderful place for a celebration or any time you want a delicious meal in a beautiful atmosphere.', 'Wonderful food and service. I have been here several times and never disappoints.', 'Superior food, attentive and cordial service on a busy Saturday night.  Room is very, very noisy and, as I am hard of hearing, I was fortunate to have my wife with me to maintain a conversation with our guest.', \"Although I enjoyed the service and ambiance very much, the food was somewhat disappointing for such an upscale Italian restaurant. House bread was flavourful and fresh. The Burrata was excellent. The Insalata di Mista was ridiculously overpriced and not remarkable in the least. Lettuce with vinegar for $18? Should have been $9.  I also wasn't overly impressed with my gnocchi. It was bland and a very mushy. One of my friends had the veal and said it was also not at all at the level that she expected. My third friend LOVED her Rigatoni Bolognese.  That's why the mostly 3 stars. I love Italian food and have been to Italy 4 times, so maybe my bar is too high.\\n\\nI would like to give it another try, especially as it's a great looking place with awesome waiters, but unless I am back in Bellevue for some reason I would probably look elsewhere.\", 'love the amazing experience and great food! \\nour favorite place for a night out or special celebration.', 'Way too noisy.\\nFood OK.\\nWould not go there again, stick to the Seattle one.\\n.', 'The service was very customer oriented and waiter met our every need..

Would definitely recommend to others.', 'Consistently great food and service.  Our go to for special occasions.', 'Our server was exceptional.

The food and service is amazing so was the wine!  Carmine’s made the night special!', 'Lively atmosphere, Tuscan decor, knowledgeable service, good food, delicious Tiramisu', \"We went to Carmine's for my birthday. The staff greeted us warmly as we walked in. Our waiter was unusually friendly and told us about the evening's specials. My wife and I ordered the cream of asparagus soup and the petrale sole both of which were excellent. The waiter brought my dessert with a candle in it. The service was outstanding and the noise level was fairly low for the size of the restaurant. Everybody had a wonderful time.\", 'Always a perfect meal. Excellent service, lovely setting, delicious ingredients and preparation. So happy you are in bellevue!', 'It was plain and simply fabulous . The food was outstanding and we enjoyed it thoroughly', 'Great food, great service and great atmosphere.  We enjoyed a nice meal with friends and each of us enjoyed our dishes.', 'Love everything about this place except the noise level. It is just way too loud no matter what part of the restaurant or bar I have sat in', 'Always love Carmines.  Service is great and the food choices are wonderful.  Thank you as always', 'Prices here are high even for Bellevue\\'s trendy spenders.  The menu items read and sound wonderful, but what comes to the table leaves much to be desired.  The risotto special, for example, was asparagus tips, roasted red peppers, topped with a lobster tail.  The peppers, far from roasted, were just softened as they cooked in the final stages of finishing the risotto and gave it a bitter, harsh taste.  A scavenger hunt turned up not a single asparagus tip; the rice had a greenish hue so perhaps it sat near an asparagus.   At some point.  The lobster tail shell was atop the risotto and the tail pulled out.  They might as well have left it in the shell: it was tough, dry, and tasteless.  \\n\\nWe alerted our server who in turn, he said, alerted the chef.  The response: a scoop of sorbet - and I promise this is what he said - \"to get the taste of the risotto out of our mouth.\"  Guess they don\\'t care about customers but see them as disposable, replaceable items.\\n\\nWhy this place is jammed to overflowing is beyond me.  When it first opened, we had a nice but not astonishing dinner yet thought it was romantic enough to return for an anniversary.  With exceptions, of course, Bellevue seems to have no end to flashy, high priced eateries where food comes in a distant third or fourth to décor, being seen, and even more absurdly priced cocktails.  Carmine\\'s fits right in that mold.\\n\\nIf you want romantic, great food, and expensive, there are several eateries way more worth it.  Back to Café Juanita or perhaps Canlis next year.', 'The food, and service excellent. But too noisy to carry on a conversation (amongst 4 people). \\nWould either go very early in the evening when it is less crowded or late in the evening to avoid the noise.', \"Food was very good, but it didn't come as listed. Photo below of steak that was supposed to come with asparagus and risotto. We didn't realize what we missed until we had already walked out.\", 'Excellent service, food quality, and attention to detail! We were celebrating my friend’s birthday, and the Carmine’s staff had written a birthday card, delivered a delicious dessert with a lit candle, and even offered to take our picture together!', 'Food was good but seemed over-priced and the service was slow.', 'Roberto was very good.  I think he would like to be a full time waiter.\\nFood was awesome.', 'Another excellent dinner, as always.', 'We enjoyed our evening.', 'Love, love, love Carmines. Tonight we had the ossobuco and halibut. Amazing- across the board. And the service is the best. Warm, friendly and outstanding.', 'I had been to the Carmines Downtown on several occasions and this was simply the same except in Bellevue.  As usual the food and service were outstanding.  The only issue we had were some fruit flies that hung around our table.  Not many but enough to be a little distracting.  They like my wife seemed particularly interested in the nice Cabernet she was having.', 'This is my favorite Italian restaurant.  The food is amazing & the service is outstanding.  We always bring family here when they visit.  It’s got a great atmosphere & vibe.', 'Lovely atmosphere. Great place for a special dinner. The food was delicious and the service was great. Definitely will come back in the future!', 'My husband and I selected Carmine’s (or is it Carmines?) to celebrate our anniversary, and it was such a memorable visit. From a hand-written anniversary card on our table, to a complimentary anniversary dessert delivered to us to cap off the meal, we felt appreciated and cared for from the start of our evening to the end of it.\\n\\nService was lovely; our server Jennifer was warm and had a great sense of humor (she seemed a little new or nervous, perhaps?). She brought us a taste of their house wine made especially for them by Betz Winery, and while it wasn’t the flavor profile we sought that evening, it was good and we were thankful for the suggestion and tasting! \\n\\nThe food was impeccable! My husband opted for the ribeye with risotto and I chose the filet with brown butter and sage gnocchi. The steaks were cooked to perfection, with visible sear marks and a salty and peppery crust. The risotto was creamy and full of sharp Parmesan flavor, while the soft pillows of gnocchi were buttery and rich. We found the steaks to be better quality, flavor, and temperature than steak houses in the area.\\n\\nMy only criticism was the price we paid for old fashioneds at the bar before our meal: $15 per drink! Sure, we opted for Maker’s Mark, and of course we expected Bellevue pricing, but there are far better old fashioneds at nearby restaurants offered for less (and most are on happy hour during the time we were here, which knocks the price down even more than normal). By contrast, Carmine’s offers wines in a variety of reasonable price ranges, which in a way makes the pricey cost of drinks at the bar stand out even more. \\n\\nRegardless, this was an incredibly delicious meal and a wonderful evening and we’ll be returning to Carmine’s to mark every special occasion we have. You should feel confident trusting them with your special evenings, too!', 'Always delicious meals. The fresh fish and produce exceeds expectations. What a gorgeous restaurant with outstanding service. A favorite place to eat.', 'Great menu but noise level too high', \"Carmine's is our favorite family restaurant, where we go to celebrate all our family occasions. Last night, we were there celebrating my dad's 81st birthday, and the food was fabulous, but the service was way off the mark for Carmine's. We have been utterly spoiled in the past by their attention to detail.  \\n I was utterly impressed that I received a call from the owner Maria today, apologizing for the lack of service.  She explained to me that there was a medical emergency that we were unaware of at the restaurant with two of the staff members.  Her kindness on the phone and her passion for her family restaurant reminded me why we would continue to select Carmines as our restaurant of choice.   We will be back, and we will recommend this restaurant to our friends.\", 'Dinner was to celebrate our 43rd Anniversary.  The service in the bar and dining room was absolutely fantastic.  All the staff we encountered were great and very helpful.  Our meal was delicious and enjoyed the smaller meals.  Very surprised when a small desert was brought out in celebration of our special day.  \\nThank you so much.', 'Professional, friendly service and EXCELLENT food. Great wine recommendation from the sommelier. Overall love, love, love Carmine’s.', 'Food and service were quite good. Liked the ambiance.

The service is excellent, the food outstanding, great atmosphere of energetic, positive and fun. The food from soups, to salads, to pasta to fish to ossobuco- all excellent.  Drinks were well mixed- good bar. And no rush- take your time and enjoy. Highly recommend Carmine's. It's the real deal.\", 'The food was incredible! The service was outstanding.

Great wine list. Perfect place to conduct business.', \"Great restaurant for any occasion.  The staff made our anniversary a very special evening. We'll definitely be back soon!\", 'Excellent.  Food was great.  Pasta, veal, and halibut all wonderful. Tiramisu out of this world.\\n\\nService on timely basis. Very helpful and subdued.\\n\\nWill be back soon.', 'Open Table really should offer \"noise\" level beyond \"energetic\",  because when you have to use sign language to discuss your dinner order with the server, that is a PROBLEM level of noise. Conversation across the table? Forget that! No chance.  Granted it was a busy TIGF crowd, some wearing flip flops and backward baseball caps, but it IS across from the Downtown Park and it IS a lively young crowd but this is one of the few Bellevue tables that cries out for the tiniest bit of attention to wardrobe. \\n\\nCarmine\\'s kindly phoned earlier in the day to say that a 7:30 seating had become available, much preferred to our initial 8:15 reservation, and that was much appreciated.\\n\\nDrinks, wine and dinner service impeccable and the quality of menu offerings a pleasure. The evening risotto with chantrells with gorgeously grilled shrimp (more like langoustines in size and flavor) was a sparkler. Will remember to skip weekends or brush up on sign language for the next visit.', 'Wine list was missing a page\\nTable was missing place setting for one person\\nBar area is very noisy', 'Always a wonderful dinner at Carmines, good value and great service.', 'Our waiter, Brent, made our evening a great experience.

We ordered a second bottle of wine, got the glasses quickly but no wine! It (the bottle of wine) did eventually make it to the table.\\n\\nI asked my sever for my fish to be clean, no butter. I don't like butter and don't like the salt bloat post dinner. Maybe a little olive oil but keep it simple. It is a $65 Copper river salmon. Let me actually taste the Copper.  It came out drenched in butter. Salted butter no less. I would have love to purchase another dish, but, how long would that take? I wanted to eat  within the calendar year. So, I ate my butter covered fish. To add salt to my open hunger wound, the waiter split my salad amongst the other dinners. I could have filled up on the salad but no chance of that either. \\n\\nWe will go back. It is rare to have bad service at Carmine's.  However, when dropping the kind of cash we did for dinner it is unacceptable. \\n\\nThe wine was good!\", 'We waited too long between the appetizer and the main dish we ordered and ended up eating a lot of bread.

Next to beautiful Bellevue park.', 'Little loud but awesome that they recognized birthday in party.', \"I felt like our waitress was rushing us and on multiple times interrupted our conversation. There wasn't nicety or appreciation for dining here, almost felt like it was just expected to drop a few hundred dollar on dinner for three. Food was really good, but I don't feel that it warrants the high prices.\", 'We asked a quieter part of the restaurant and it was really nice. Service was attentive but not rushed. The food was really exceptional.', 'Everything was excellent except it was loud in there. I would recommend still going there.', \"Carmine's is excellent. Old world Italian feel in the heart of DT Bellevue with food to match. We're picky about our Italian food, but would happily bring my Italian MIL to dine. \\n\\nThere was a big party, so it was a bit noisy, but good ambience otherwise. Valet Parking (Red Carpet Valet) were terrible and we didn't even use them...its the only half mark against this restaurant...great otherwise!\", 'Always friendly and welcoming. Staff is upbeat and positives if they are inviting one to dine in their home.', 'Excellent food excellent service, a bit crowded and very noisy', 'The tables along the perimeter of the main dining area are set too close together and doesn’t allow enough space between the parties.  This makes it difficult to have an intimate conversation between two people with others sitting so close on either side.', 'Went there to celebrate an anniversary.   They did a great job with a special note and anniversary message during and literally part of the desert to end the evening. The service and food were fantastic.', 'My favorite place for dinner! Food and service amazing as always!', 'We were all (party of 7) very disappointed with: service, food, and noise level. We had to wait forever for the drinks to be served, and by the time the waiter asked if anyone would like a 2nd drink it was almost the end of the meal. Everyone ordered a starter and either their own entree or shared an entree. 50% of the food served was not tasty or prepared correctly, with components of a dish missing from the plate. My husband couldn’t even eat the mushroom soup and when the waiter noticed he said he would deduct it from the check, but didn’t. We had early dinner reservations but it was still so noisy we could barely carry on a conversation. The cost of the meal reflected an expensive restaurant, but our experience was far from that. None of us would return there or recommend it.', 'Came on a friends recommendation and can see why this house is so busy.. Carmine’s is a well oiled machine, with beautiful food, drinks and staff. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with fresh flowers everywhere you turn. Everyone that serves is clearly happy and fully engaged from front desk on.\\nWhat other places aspire to but rarely achieve..Carmine’s gets it.', 'This Carmine location Is fantastic. Glad they kept the same menu as the downtown restaurant. Always enjoy my time here!', 'Service is excellent. Food is mediocre. Decor is bland and sterile.', \"We celebrated our anniversary with another couple, and Carmine's was very attentive all night - it really made us feel special.\\nOur guest brought a special bottle of champagne and the Carmine's staff made sure we were served properly. The food was great and our guests were very impressed since it was their first visit there. We'll be back!\", \"I booked a table to celebrate my wife's birthday at Carmine's. Both of us are vegetarians and we were apprehensive about whether this place would have any options for us, but we were surprised with the food and wine options. The potato dumpling and the creme of Asparagus were amazing. Thanks for the birthday cake.\", 'Presentation is very good but food does not seem to be the same caliber as when they opened.', 'Service was impeccable. We asked for the quietest table secondary to a hearing deficit and it was still too loud.', \"We've been to Carmine's a few times, and every time is outstanding! Our server Hayley(believe that was her name) was great. My girlfriend has a severe beef allergy, and they are always super helpful wish dishes. Great place to dine!!\", 'Beautiful restaurant with excellent service, but the food is not good at all. In our opinion, the Carmine’s in downtown Seattle is much better.', \"My family & I are regulars at Carmine's in Bellevue. We love the atmosphere and the food is fantastic. Favorites include Antipasti appetizer, Brown Butter Sage Gnocchi, Veal Scallopini, The Lamb Chops & Pork Chops.\", 'Great service as always with alberto and the food never disappoints', 'Would have been nice to know there was a garage with parking.

The osso bucco was fantastic - so good\", 'Our dinner was on a Monday evening, celebrating a birthday, and there were two other parties doing the same, so it was not at all crowded, and clearly a place chosen for special occasions. The service was excellent. Food was great. We can recommend the Caesar salad, and the King Salmon dish with risotto.', \"Great meal!  Excellent service.  We have been here twice and it's been great both times.\", 'Although service was excellent food was horrible. Neither we will go back there nor recommend this restaurant to others.', 'Nice for a couple to have a few glasses of wine', 'Our server and the front greeting staff were both A+. Attentive and professional. My wife ordered the seafood linguini and I ordered the bone in pork chop. My wife loved the seafood linguini. Me?  Well the pork chop was not great. I ate two bites. The servers noticed that I was not eating, and came back to thaw the pork chop away. They apologized and immediately brought me a feee desert and took the pork chop off my bill. We were very impressed of this level of friendly service. We will be back to eat there again.', \"I have been to Carmine's five times for business and pleasure with family. All I can say is amazing. Each time I am surprised, in a good way, by something. This time was a business lunch with an old colleague, we needed a catch-up and to establish a way forward.  We agreed it was wonderful, lasted just long enough, and the food - well off the charts.\", 'Best Salad Niciose I’ve ever had!

Make sure you ask for a quiet table otherwise your money will be wasted!\\nGreat food and service though!', 'Great place for classic Italian dinner, just be ready to pay.  If  you are looking for a place where you can talk over the dinner- this place is not for you. Perfect spot to bring grandparents.', 'Fun location and great good!', 'as usual great service and wonderful food.  ENjoyed the entire experience.', \"We come every year for my husband's birthday, he counts the days until he has his sweet bread. This year pancetta was added and he felt it was a bit overpowering. No worries he will just adjust his sweet bread order. I had the specific Rib Eye it was huge but somehow when my plate was cleared it was empty. We will see you again.\", 'Like Carmine\\'s quite a bit.  Hosted a private dinner for 14 in January and it was great.  Dinner the other evening was not up to par.  Food was just mediocre and we shared our views with the staff.  They attempted to make it right but comping the pasta and bringing a desert does not make up for the loss of the total experience.  My partner has Parkinson\\'s and not sure how many more dining \"experiences\" we will have together.  So when one goes bad we notice it.', 'Nice place. Authentic cuisine. Table was in high traffic area. Ask for one by a window for more intimate experience', 'Wonderful meal, perfect food and beverage experience!  As good as the original', 'Food was absolutely amazing, the care they put into that and making you feel like family is perfection!', 'Great date night restaurant. Our server was very attentive and always on top of things. The only drawback was the two-person table could be a little more spacious. Felt good just for drinks, but having drinks, appetizers and main entree get little tight.', 'Just overall professionalism and attention.  Like the personable staff and all their smiles.  Great service.', 'Superior food and incredible service! This restaurant never fails to deliver an excellent dining experience whether you’re on a date night or special celebration. PAOLA is by far the best waiter in Seattle- a skilled professional with a personal touch. You will not be disappointed!', 'Wonderful food and service!  \\nSecond time at the Bellevue location, we usually make the trip downtown - \\nbut this is more convenient to Issaquah.', 'The food was excellent. Our waiter was exceptional but the busboy had a serious frown on his face. Whenever he would fill out glass of water he seemed angry. Everyone else was smiling and friendly. I would have given a perfect 10 except for this experience.', 'Delicious food as always.  I do have to modify my meals at most places to be gf and df and they complied but not with much creativity. Have the waiters and waitresses wear something else besides the ugly and ill fitting head waiter jackets. They dont look comfy wearing them. Would love a cocktail menu as well.', 'Paul was an amazing server! The entire staff is welcoming and kind. We felt like we were transported to Italy. From the beginning to end, there was a great attentiveness to detail. Food tasted delicious! Cannelloni is really good here. And birthday dessert was a cherry to the top. They make birthdays special here. Loved it! Will be back.', \"Nothing beats Carmine's for a world-class italian meal\", 'Awesome overall.  Excellent food and great staff.  Highly recommend!!', 'Best place for lunch (or dinner) in Bellevue; enough said.', 'The steak was absurdly bad, I should’ve known better than to order a steak at an Italian joint but you’d think a 50 dollar steak anywhere should be devoid of tendons and jibberish in every bite. I ended up spitting out half of the masticated beef cause I couldn’t get it down... pasta seemed good thou, but damn... that steak was almost worst than dennys', 'The best salmon I have ever had!', '2nd time celebrating at Carmine’s.  Love it!\\nGreat service, food and ambiance!!', 'Foods were excellent. I had  king salmon .  It was cooked just right  Meat were very tender and delicious. I liked it very much.  Highly recommended. If you like to dine in a fancy place with tasty foods, this is one of the best place to go. Table setting was nice. The only negative is noise level. It was a bit difficult in hearing the conversation.', 'I reserved Carmines for my husband’s birthday dinner. The staff was great. They made special effort to make our evening special by serving complimentary tiramisu with a birthday message. The food was outstanding. Highly recommend. We will visit again.', \"We enjoyed our dinner at Carmine's.  The staff was excellent.  The restaurant is noisy, so I wouldn't call it romantic.  The bruschetta appetizer was excellent.  The caesar salad was a real disappointment; I make a better one out of a package from the grocery store.  My husband had lamb.  He said it was very good, but not superb.  I had an excellent filet mignon, but the gnocchi that came with it was uninspired.  The lemon meringue dessert was, for me, the best part of the meal.  As meringues go, it was wonderfully done.  My husband said his profiteroles were very good--it is a dessert meant for two, though!  We would go there again, although we would definitely skip the salad course and go for one of their less pricey entrees.\", 'We celebrated 2 birthdays; my husbands and my girlfriends. The 4 of us sat in the lounge and had dinner. The service from the minute we walked in and the hostess sat us to our waiter who was also the bartender was impeccable! 3 of us had the scallop and risotto special, King Salmon and pasta Italian sausage...all amazing!', 'Excellent food and service. Noise level above tolerable to the point I had to shout to my companion to have a conversation.', 'This is the only place in all of Bellevue worth eating. It is exceptional in every way. The best every single time.', 'I used to love Carmine’s food but this time, I was very disappointed with the quality of duck breast.  In addition risotto was strange. It does not taste like risotto at all.  Surprisingly  cioppino tastes quite bland as well.  Thank god that  vodka cream source pasta was  still delicious.   Given this not so great experience, I am not sure that I will  go back again.', 'Good food, great service, but way too loud for a nice dinner for two.', 'Our food was significantly delayed\\nBoth tables next to us were seated after us and were served before us, in fact the table to our right turned over twice before we got our food.\\nThey did apologize and offered us free dessert', 'Very attentive service. their food is delicious.', 'Great place to celebrate a birthday. Service was amazing along with the food. Highly recommend.', 'Carmine\\'s is always my \"Go to\" place to gather for with friends or family to celebrate an occasion, or to just have a romantic evening with my husband. Food is always wonderful, as is the service.', 'This was my first time here at the recommendation of a friend and I was VERY impressed.  From the moment I walked in.  From the service to the food, this is a wonderful place and I will return many times!', \"A new client treated my wife and I to dinner at Carmine's.

The food is exceptionally delicious!', 'Unobtrusive service with impeccable timing \\nTable side French service is a nice touch\\nOutstanding food quality with possibly the best Caesar I have ever had', 'Great Italian restaurant in the heart of Bellevue. I ordered the pesto fettuccine with prawns & if you’re pesto lover like myself then you will love this dish. I can’t wait to go back.', \"Everything was great about the evening except the valet.  Food was great, service was excellent, it's a expensive, but very good.\", 'We had a wonderful experience! Our waitor was very nice and helpful - not snooty at all. Food was great!  Best bread and bruscetta ever! We will be back!', 'Wonderful experience, food and service. We arrived early and used valet. There were two seats at the bar and we had a drink and appetizer while we waited for our table. The bar staff were very friendly. The table was ready right at our reservation time and again, service was wonderful. We went with the two specials tomahawk steak and risotto with crab cakes. So glad we did because they were both exceptional. The steak in particular was perfectly cooked and had an amazing peppercorn crust.', 'We made reservations via open-table and was seated on a four top in the middle of the dining room. My waitress was pretty busy with a 5 top and 4 top and 2 top in my area. I had the cauliflower soup as a starter and the ossobucco for dinner. The wine list came when dinner came and a waiter came by to help us pick a suitable wine in short order. Although the food was good it could have been 5 stars with more Italian zest and pop.', 'nope service and ambiance is good but the food just was no where near where it should of been. I would of preferred burger king, or a nice steak joint or almost anywhere.', 'Carmine’s is the best Italian in Bellevue. We went for our third Valentine’s Day in a row and it’s the best experience you could ask for. Amazing wine, bolognese, lobster risotto, wine, etc. Such a beautiful space, too!', \"This was our first time at the Carmine's in Bellevue...even though we've been to the one in Seattle.  We enjoyed it VERY much.  Food was delicious and service excellent.  It equals the Seattle restaurant, but is much easier to get to for us.  We will definitely go back whenever we want yummy Italian food.  It is a high-end restaurant for sure, but we think it's worth the price.\", 'One of the best restaurants in Bellevue.  The food, service and ambiance are just top notch. It is a great choice for any special occasion.', 'Always a great time and the food is fantastic. Love the friendly staff.', 'This place is amazing -- the food is exquisite and the wine list massive ($$$).  Love going here, the staff are so amazing.', 'When you want a really good meal this is the place to go....if you’re looking in for “foam” or avant garde ingredients then try somewhere else.....and that’s what is great about this place.', 'Tanya was and always has been a great waitperson.  Please let her know how much we appreciate her.', 'We love Carmine’s. We probably dine there once a month. The food is fantastic (our favorite in Bellevue), the service is great and the atmosphere is beautiful. The only negative is when the restaurant is busy it’s quite loud in there. They always take great care of us! We’re already looking forward to our next visit.', 'Everything was perfect.', 'Outstanding dinner, wine and service. We will most certainly add this to our list of places to go for a special night out.', 'VERY LOUD!\\nAND TABLES ARE VERY CLOSE... THE LOCATION IN SEATTLE IS MORE INTIMATE', 'Great service and the food was fantastic.  We had salmon, veal, rigatoni, and some good wine.   Wine is a little pricey. The noise level was appropriate for a good restaurant with good energy.', 'Excellent service, food and ambience. A must try in Seattle.', 'Very noisy space but experience made up for it.', 'Tried Carmine’s for the first time to celebrate my brother’s birthday. They had a nice Happy Birthday card on the table, which was nice. Food was great, service was awesome will most definitely be back!', 'We had a lovely lunch there. The service was excellent. The food, however, was very expensive, especially for lunch!  The special black cod was a very small piece, excellently prepared, on a very small helping of risotto. The only accompaniment was a very small carrot and 5 green beans. This fetched a $40 price at lunch. The tiramisu was a lovely ending. Bring your wallet!', 'I love this place! You have to try the Osos Bucco.', 'It was so loud and they had so many groups that our party of 7 could not talk without literally shouting at eachother to be heard. And we were even seated in the corner! They had several very large groups and one in particular that would have been better suited at a sports bar than a fine dining establishment.\\n\\nWe’ve loved our visits in the past but our evening was ruined when we couldn’t hold a conversation because of the noise level.', \"Celebrating my husband's 90th.....ate in the bar which has nice ambiance.  Altho the bartender's booming voice is somewhat a distraction,  it beat the large group in the banquet room near the other tables.  We enjoyed out selections -  my husband really liked his osso bucco, something that he does not get at home.  My cream of cauliflower soup was wonderful, by sm order of pasta with pesto and prawns was ok but nothing special.  We shared the cannoli, a favorite of ours but hard to match what I had in Sicily many trips ago.  \\nA nice evening in an upscale, rather expensive restaurant.\", 'Wonderful place to celebrate a birthday or special occasion.', \"My wife and I love Carmine's - both in Seattle and Bellevue.  We have become frequent diners at the Bellevue location because it is near our home, and we really prefer the bar atmosphere in that location to the Seattle location (although, Intermezzo is a really nice choice for bar atmosphere).  Our go to meal is generally to share the antipasti plate, and then each choose an entrée and then share a bottle of Italian wine.  The wine list is really great, and it has everyone's favorites from the Northwest, which is really great, and sometimes we go in that direction, but, we mostly like to let the staff pick out a bottle of Italian wine for us since we don't know those wines well.  On our latest visit, we dined in the dining room, and Kellen was our waiter.  really great guy who is passionate about food and wine.  We have also dined at the chef's table/bar that overlooks the kitchen.  That is also fun -- my favorite dish is the veal rib chop, and my always goes with their fresh fish selection.  And, their pastas are always first rate, too, and it's nice that you can share.\", \"We have dined at Il Terrazzo's in Seattle and it is one of our favorite places. Carmine's in Bellevue is far from the experience at Il Terrazzo's. The food lacked character, the noise level was terrible, the service was good and the prices were too much for what was being offered. We won't be going there again. It was an expensive mistake!\", 'This has to be one of the best restaurants in Bellevue. Such good food, and very attentive wait staff. Highly recommend eating here!', 'Everything was perfect!', 'We arrived for an early supper and were greeted warmly and led to a nicely private table. Which was good because I find most restaurants too noisy these days. \\nOn wait person was at ease and genuine. Another nice trait. \\nOur food although not deserving of 5 stars, would be a solid four. The wine list was strong and had a good variety. Dinner and wine for 4 was $500. $200 of that being wine.', 'Great food. Had the risotto special with crab cake and my friend had the bolognese. Both were excellent. We had a great bottle wine recommendation from the sommelier after giving him our price point. Downside of visit was the table we were given. Horrible place to sit right next to pillar. Also our service was quite slow. Dessert was delicious. I had panna cotta and my friend had fruit and cheese plate. Beautiful restaurant!', 'Always amazing!', 'Overall it was a fantastic experience. Food was priced reasonably.  The staff were friendly and very eccentric.', 'Our server was amazing, I can remember his name- but had glasses and red hair. He recommended great dishes and was so kind to our daughter. The food was amazing, our drinks were on point. This was a great experience.', 'AMAZING - staff is unbelievable and the food is spectacular', 'Carmines is a very warm & inviting restaurant.  The food is good & the service is excellent.  We met friends & tried a bunch of dishes family style.  They have changed  the Bruschetta recipe think  I like the one they had earlier better.  \\nWill be back.', 'Always outstanding service and very friendly.  Excellent food and a very nice presentation.', 'Luise is the best!  He is a fantastic server, and the food is fantastic.  Bravo!', \"Carmine's is great. Our office has been many times and everything is amazing especially our waitress who we have had the pleasure of being served by many times. It is great to return to a restaurant after not visiting for 6 months and see the staff is the same and the food is still just as delicious!!\", 'Never disappoints...great food, excellent service', \"I have been at Carmines three times before this past weekend.  Every business has an off night - I was just surprised Carmine's had one at all.  Besides the deafening noise reflected by the glass in the corner (patio door and main window), the pasta was overcooked and very crunchy.  Kellan, the waiter, explained that the noodles are cooked in the morning and heated up later for dinner.  Since our party ate at 5pm at the first sitting, we caught the worst of this pre-preparation.  The prior times I have been to Carmine's have been excellent, other than the noise levels.  The manager came over and gave us one dinner free, which was indicative of the customer service you can expect there.  So a little disappointing, but I will come back in a few months.  They cannot take the name for granted and ride on the Seattle flagships coattails.  There are too many great options in Bellevue, Kirkland now, even in Redmond.\"]\n",
