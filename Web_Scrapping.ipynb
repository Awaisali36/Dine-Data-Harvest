They immediately offer to decant it for us and of course we shared a glass of the wine with the waitperson.   Food and service were terrific, and we are looking forward to our next visit.', 'My first time here. Food, atmosphere and bar experience was great. What wasn’t so great was our experience with our waitor. Did not make us feel welcome and made us feel rushed. Without introduction or summarizing the specials, he just said “are you ready to order?”\\nBecause we didnt want to reward bad behavior with our tip, we requested a new waitor and she was wonderful! Without telling her of our experience she gave an introduction, summarized the specials, and gave us her recommendations. Overall good. Because everyone other than the first waitor was great, it’s not a reflection of the establishment. Will return again.', 'Food and service were excellent.

Thank you Carmines', 'Go hungry and be prepared for a fabulous meal! The Caprese, Caesar, Linguini Vongole, and Salmon pasta dishes were exceptional as was the fresh warm bread basket. The wine was also very good. We had a great bottle during our previous visit however this time, we only wanted a glass to accompany our meal. Since the wine could only be purchased by the bottle, our server brought us a couple of samples to try. Kudos for going the extra mile! He described it as local and fairly priced. Our mistake because we didn’t ask the price…yikes…it was $25/ glass. Wont be doing that again!', 'Once again the whole team at Carmine’s treated us to an amazing dining experience.

If you love blue cheese like I do, these are a must!\\n- Risotto Tiberio. Ive had this here before and it was so amazing. Perfectly cheesy and fluffy with generous servings of seafood.\\n- Crab Rigatoni - so creamy and the crab was just perfection.\\n- Spaghetti di finochio + meatball. Trust me the meatball is worth it!

Expectations were high based on past dining experiences. We had La CapreseBuffala mozzarella for appetizer, tomatoes were heirloom quality, their house bread (with the perfect chew factor IMO) was offered multiple times,  although I wished it was warmed, the butter was soft; the best part of lunch was the d Cream of cauliflower Gratinée, delicious, flavorful, rich, but not overly so. Entrees were Clam Linguine, with a generous portion of clams, Caesar Salad, nicely prepared and Spaghetti Ortolano, was lackluster, I think they forgot to toss in the olive oil.  The two desserts were both worth every bite: tiramisu (in fact I took an additional slice home) and lemon meringue was Instagram worthy. \\n\\nLunch is not usually the best showing for any fine restaurant and that needs to be taken into consideration. The restaurant itself is impeccably cared for, clean, bright, beautiful. The experience was not as hoped for, no mention of celebrating a special occasion, even though I had noted it. I will say the owner called me after I left a note about the experience and I do believe this less than 5 star experience was an anomaly. I will go back and still cannot think of another restaurant in Seattle that I'd rather have a special meal.\", 'We celebrated our Anniversary.

They were able to change my reservation and squeeze us in at an earlier time. They had a congratulations card waiting for her at the table. The staff were all congratulating her throughout the night. And they brought her a complimentary piece of tiramisu cake with Congratulations written in cursive with chocolate \\nFOOD: Delectable. Their pastas were delicious and the dessert 10/10.

What a wonderful way to celebrate my birthday!\\nThank you Steven for being such an attentive and professional wait person.', 'Excellent food and good service.  However - don’t go if it’s a hot day in Bellevue. Inside the dining room was so uncomfortably hot, it took away our appetite.  (Apparently they have no AC.).  Typically at this restaurant, we give all 5 star reviews.  This was definitely NOT our normal experience at Carmine’s.', 'A frequent diner at Carmines. This trip was really average.

We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and offered many great suggestions for myself as I am gluten and diary free. \\n\\nThe decor makes me feel like I am in Italy! Super romantic.

Our server, Ron was so wonderful. He was so attentive and so kind to our 9-year-old son. After we ordered wine, our son wanted a soda, but we wouldn't allow another sugary drink since he already had one during the day. Ron suggested some lemon wedges to put in his water to make it extra special & that did the trick, our son was thrilled.\\n\\nRon told us about the daily specials and made great recommendations. I mentioned that I wanted to try something new since I always get the crab risotto or the veal. Ron said the halibut was really good, and that they do halibuts really well. It came with on a bed of parmesan risotto with saffron sauce and some veggies. I love their risottos (crab, lobster etc) so I decided on this dish, my husband followed. We absolutely loved it! If you love caesar salad like we do, Carmine's have one of the best caesars around! The dressing has a hint of green like pesto, makes it extra special. They always make up a special plate (kids portion) for our son (spaghetti with one big meatball). They are pretty good about making up a special plate that is not on the menu. Our son once wanted a pepperoni pizza and they made it for him.\\n\\nWe just love this place! Thanks for making our Mother's Day meal special Ron!\", 'Everyone here was gracious and wonderful to work with. The food was superb and the ambience magnificent!', 'Excellent burrata special.

The food, however, was the highlight and was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Anatra Arosto Alle Ciliege (dry-aged duck) medium and the cook was spot-on. My fiancée ordered the fish special, which in this case was lightly battered halibut, and said that hers was perfect as well.

Every time.', 'We went to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. We were a group of 5 with an 8 pm reservation. While the food was incredible, our server couldn’t have been more snide and inattentive. He greeted us, asked about drinks and walked away before we could order because my daughter asked about mocktails. He came back about 20 minutes later and we ordered drinks, a bottle of wine and appetizers. Our appetizers were delivered before our wine was opened. He just left the unopened bottle of wine on the table. We were nearly 50 minutes into our reservation time before the wine was opened and served.\\n\\nI’ve never spent $600 on a dinner to be treated so poorly. The consensus across the board was excellent food (except the crab risotto which was fishy),beautiful and festive atmosphere, but not worth being treated like we’re beneath another person.\\n\\nEdit: The owners from Carmine contacted me this morning.

I ordered it medium well but it looked like it was dropped into a fire pit and left there. It was charred all over! The edges were surrounded by burned fat - yuck. It also came in a surprising sweet sauce, which did not go well with steak. Overall, it was a very expensive but very mediocre entre. Our appetizers were fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The bread, on the other hand, was heavenly! It\\'s the only thing that was great about Carmine\\'s. Service was good but they did not even acknowledge our anniversary celebration, besides a \"Happy Anniversary\" card left on the table.

Kind of noisy when full on a Saturday night. Certainly will go back.\", 'We had a delightful lunch at Carmine’s in Bellevue, the service was impeccable without being intrusive.  It was very loud when we first arrived, but as the tables emptied the noise level was pleasant.  I had a pasta dish that was delicious and my friend had an entree salad that was good, but visually looked like a large amount of lettuce with a chicken breast laid over the top. It was much less appealing than my pasta, and somewhat hard to eat, since there was so much lettuce on the plate.  Carmine’s is a lovely restaurant with a warm interior and a cozy patio that would perfect if the weather is nice.', 'Delicious lobster risotto and halibut special.

Mushroom soup was pretty flat as was the veal ravioli - we expected more from this type of restaurant.\", 'We went there for an anniversary and the food was great, service was excellent and seemed to know when we needed something without interrupting us too much.

Great Italian food.', 'Excellent as always! Service and food was fabulous.', \"Carmine's is a favorite for us.  Excellent food, impeccable service.  The only drawback is the noise level.

Perhaps next time we'll request a table in the corner.\", 'Love it!  Always!  Never disappointed   Will always return.', 'They are famous for their gnocchi but ours was watery and not very good! We also had crab risotto which was so fishy we had to send it back. The salmon was amazing. Also, we all had Caesar salads and the dressing tasted more like watered down blue cheese  - there was no anchovy or traditional caesar flavor at all. Overall kind of a weird night taste wise for what is usually a stellar restaurant!', 'Everything is amazing from the food, to the service and the drinks, my new favorite place', 'I have always enjoyed my meal but tonight my chicken piccata was beyond salty, extremely dry and very disappointing. Carmines is a nice dinner out for us and this was the first time I am now hesitant to come back for how expensive the meals are.', \"Beautiful restaurant. Service was great. Fun atmosphere, can't wait to go back.\", \"Great service, great food. Expensive and the noise level gets fairly high due to popularity/full dining room. I recommend if money and noise aren't deterrents to great food and service.\", 'Overall experience was great. Only issue was one dessert came after the other 3 were already done eating.', 'Favorite restaurant hands down.  Eat here all the time and always above and beyond expectations.  Food is so good!!!', 'Had a reservation for 2 for an anniversary dinner, and the service was wonderful and food was amazing!! The waitress, Ali, was super sweet and gave great suggestions for us. I asked for her suggestion between the gnocchi and rigatoni, and she recommended the rigatoni between the two. Ali suggested we split a large rigatoni into two smaller plates, with a small gnocchi too. As someone who doesn’t go to Italian restaurants often, nor do I know much about pasta, having those suggestions were so helpful! The rigatoni was delicious, and I highly recommend it for first-timers. The gnocchi was amazing as well, and it was really filling too. Even the small size would have me full on its own. We skipped appetizers, meats, and the pizza menu, but would love to try those next time. Since it was our anniversary, we received a complimentary dessert (tiramisu) at the end of the night and shared it between us two. The tiramisu was delicious, and even the chocolate sauce used for the writing was good too.\\n\\nAs for placing the reservation, I called to place a reservation at the patio, but didn’t receive a call back until about an hour or two later. I went ahead and reserved online instead, and once I got their call, we mentioned our online reservation and asked to be in the patio. The lady on the phone was very nice as well, and updated our reservation very quickly! \\n\\nDefinitely will come back another time! Such wonderful service and food, and the ambience is wonderful. The heaters kept us warm throughout the entire dinner, and the patio is extremely pretty at night. Thank you to the team at Carmine’s for a memorable anniversary dinner!', 'Food was mediocre. I had fairly high expectations going in but the best thing we had was the Caesar salad. Definitely skip the risotto, it was super bland', 'We loved the portions, atmosphere, menu and the amazing service with Michael. We will be back!', 'Always excellent food,  perfectly friendly service,  and beautiful space!', 'The best, as always! So delicious and the best service', 'Wonderful setting for lunch. Great ambiance with less unwanted noise than many other restaurants.', 'Heavenly experience.\\nI make it a point to go there often', 'Absolutely fantastic experience, food was superb and the waitress was excellent and attentive. Highly recommend a visit.', \"The foods was not impressed.  We ordered the new york steak, it was very thin and the waiter didn't ask how do we want it.  It turned out rough and dry.  The squid ink angel hair was nothing special, tomato sauce with seafoods.  The only highlight was the cream of mushroom soup.  The waiter was great, nice and clear.\", 'Incredible food, great service, very very loud! Couldn’t hear across the table.', 'One of my go to places ….another first class service experience', 'Love the experience every time at Carmine’s!

They surprised us with a birthday Tiramisu (which are also amazing).', 'Food was great, service was impeccable.\\nWas a little noisy', 'Food was below average for the price. The amount of seafood was much less than expected. The spaghetti was overcooked.', \"Eat lunch at Carmines often and love being in Daniel's section.  Daniel is highly professional and friendly.  Lists the specials like a pro and is very attentive but not overly so.  Always enjoy our meals at Carmines and the people at the front are so helpful with the parking garage process.\", 'Great service, food, wine for a special Anny evening. I understand why reservations book fast.', 'Love it at Carmine’s so pretty and food is delicious!', \"I love everything about Carmines.  I can't say enough good things.\", 'The venue is small and the night we went it was very busy. It is not a quiet restaurant, but the energy is fantastic, the food is authentic and well prepared, and the service is outstanding. Everyone working there seemed to care about us and was proud of the restaurant. What a wonderful experience. The prices are very reasonable as well.', 'What a wonderful evening. Beautiful night in Bellevue. The food was incredible. And the staff so lovely to my dad for his birthday celebration. Big shout out to Julia the hostess and our waiter, Ryan. \\nThank you to all!', \"Carmine's is always a pleasure.  The food is outstanding (had the black pasta with seafood at lunch yesterday) and the service excellent.

People are always pleasant and welcoming; the food is always great.\", 'Wonderful lunch at Carmine’s this week with friends we haven’t seen since Covid began. Delicious halibut offering which we all opted for,  and enjoyed. The price point is high but service and food quality is well worth it.', 'Great food!  It lives up to its reputation.  The lobster risotto was a dream.\\n\\nSpecial kudos to the valet service — prompt, accessible, and friendly.  This is especially important for us octogenarians.', 'The eggplant parm was outstanding. Their tomato sauce is excellent. Flavors are wonderful.', \"What a lovely experience. Not only the food was amazing but Service was out of this world! We came here for a celebration and Carmine's made sure that we were celebrated with a beautiful table setup, dessert, and patio seating. Thank you especially Natalie for coordinating and Micheal for serving us\", 'Mista salad lettuce was soggy, steak was excellent', 'Clearly this is a 5 star restaurant.  All the food items were excellent including the bread. Service was top notch. Cappuccino was extremely delicious.  Cocktail was very good and wine by the glass a little pricey but not unreasonable.  The only miss was on the frozen chocolate mouse dessert.  We would not order it again.\\n\\nWhile we knew validated free parking was available, valet parking was a nice splurge.\\n\\nVibrant scene at the downtown Bellevue Park adds to the ambiance.', 'I do wish that they had music playing throughout the restaurant. I know sometimes they do but today they did not and although my husband and I had a good time, the ambience felt boring.', 'We loved it here - first time but definitely not the last.  Great food, great staff, beautiful decor, huge wine and spirit options.  Their specials were amazing as well.  The only two drawbacks: no sommelier and it was really loud inside the dining room - REALLY loud.  Won’t stop\\nus from returning - but we will probably going earlier and during the week instead.', 'Great evening! It was my birthday and we got complimentary deserts. Door excellent as always.', 'Carmines is a great place to take clients. very classy environment', \"We were celebrating our wedding anniversary & they were able to get us a table early since there was no room at the bar to sit & have a drink.  There was a nice 'Happy Anniversary' note on the table and our waiter was very knowledgable and friendly.  The food is always very good and of the highest quality.  This is our 'go to' for a nice dinner because the service is amazing and the food delicious.\", 'Always a wonderful experience.  Had the steak salad special for lunch and it was fantastic. I only wish I could have eaten their homemade bread but I am gluten free.  It smelled so good.  Umberto was our waiter and he timed our lunch perfectly.  Always at the top of my list when I visit Bellevue.', 'The BEST Italian on the Eastside!  Fresh and always delicious.', \"My birthday dinner at Carmine's was amazing! Everyone made us feel welcomed, and multiple people wished me a happy birthday. The ambiance was perfect, the food was delicious, and our server Ali was amazing! Probably one of my favorite servers I've ever had. I also highly recommend the tiramisu. We were only visiting the area but if we lived there we would definitely be back to see Ali and to have more delicious Italian food!\", 'We had a fabulous birthday celebration for our daughter. Carmines allowed us to add a 5th guest to our reservation at the last minute. Our server was excellent, and the food & drinks and desserts were awesome.', \"We reserved ahead of time and specified that it was a special occassion when making the reservation. When we arrived, they had a table waiting for us. Unfortunately, it was smack dab in the middle of a very busy walkway with people knocking into it every time they passed. Knowing that it was a special occassion, I think Carmine's could have given us a better table, so that was annoying. Thankfully, when we complained, they did seat us at another table and the waitress completely made up for our bad first impression. She provided wonderful service, helped us select a great bottle of wine and made jokes with our teenagers. The food was delicious and we ended up having a really enjoyable dinner.\", 'Wonderful place, tasty food , nice location . Really recommend this place', \"Great service. Daniel was exceptional.\\n\\nOnly con was no TP in women's bathroom…\", 'I wanted to take my girls out for a classy, authentic Italian dinner, and I thought this place would be great for that, but it wasn\\'t. Although the decor is nice, it gives off the ambiance of a Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of how loud it is, and that was a big turn-off to me. We went on a Wednesday night, so I can’t even imagine what it\\'s like on Friday or Saturday.  Our waiter was a jerk, to put it nicely, he was more concerned with the larger table, probably assuming the tip would be better, he barely checked on us and when I asked a question he spoke to me a condescending and disrespectful manner. It\\'s expensive, and I expected that. However, you’re essentially forced to buy a bottle of wine if you want a glass because they charge $25-30 for 1 glass of wine, which is ridiculous. The bottles of wine are outrageously overpriced, and when I asked what the house wine was, the waiter sarcastically responded, \"There\\'s no such thing.\" I\\'ve been to more expensive restaurants than this one, and even they sell a reasonably priced house wine. The food was a step up from Olive Garden, nothing spectacular.  The manager did come over and make it right in the end, but honestly, the night was already ruined at that point. Definitely will never return to this restaurant.', 'First visit here, and we would highly recommend.\\nFrom the moment we walked in the door, the bar and our dinner table we were taken care of.\\nWonderful experience and dinner was delicious!\\n\\nWe will definitely come back!', 'We came to celebrate my husbands birthday on Tuesday night.  \\nThe food was delicious. \\nThe waiter was very professional. \\nThe warm fresh bread kept coming as our 15 year old son was very hungry. \\n\\nCons: \\nVery very loud. \\nNot a lot of room between tables \\nNot enough servers/ waiters between the tables.', 'I would not recommend going for lunch unless you are walking.  It was stated on my reminder from Open Table that their is a valet for $5 OR parking in their building.  Neither was available.  The restaurant said that they no longer offer parking for lunch & according to my guest she said that the reason I could not get into the garage is probably because it was full.  Their was only one space when she got it & there could not have been more than 10 spaces available for the retail.', 'We had a wonderful meal at Carmine’s, but it was so noisy that our table of 4 had a hard time  talking to each other. An outdoor table might have been a better choice!', 'Food was very good and service excellent.  It was really warm yesterday and the restaurant became quite toasty so took away a bit from the ambience and experience.', \"Long time patrons back to the 90's in Seattle.  We were looking forward to King salmon but found out you only offer farm raised salmon??!\", 'Fantastic food, great service! Will be going back!', \"One of my favorite restaurants in the greater Seattle area, by far the numero Uno Italian restaurant.\\nIt's impressive how this great team is able to sustain such great service, exceptional food, and an amazing ambiance for years.\\nIt's a delight to come here again and again.

I was contacted by management and they were super apologetic and appreciative of the feedback. We were there tonight (8/28/23) to celebrate my moms 80th with our family and the service could not have been better. Everything was perfect and vey true to Carmine’s.  We booked a table for our daughters bday next month and can’t wait. Thank Carmines for continuing to be our favorite spot in Bellevue. AMBIANCE AND SERVICE 5 STAR!!Carmines is our go to but this visit wasn’t great. We had friends in town and were excited to bring them but we were hugely disappointed with the service this time. We were at a table over by the bathrooms and it was like they forgot about us. We weren’t even sure who our waiter was.  Embarrassing after we talked up how great Carmine’s is. We have a reservation in a few days for a birthday celebration and I’m hoping it’s not as disappointing as this visit was.', 'Hard to find a restaurant that excels at everything but Carmines definitely does it.', 'Most of the food was very good. Halibut was disappointing. It did not seem fresh. Not flaky or tasty.\\nKat was great waiter. Outdoor seating is very pleasant.', 'Love food and the ambience at Carmine’s but service was not great this time. Disappointing as we had family visiting us and the experience just didn’t live up to our expectations.', 'Amazing experience at this beautiful, professional, welcoming and all around happy establishment.

I will definitely recommend it to my friends!', 'Took my sister for her birthday during lunch and the service was attentive, professional but not pretentious. Whether a daytime lunch or evening out, Carmine’s does not disappoint.', 'I am a frequent customer. I enjoy lunch here with antipasto, sometimes a chef pizza, chioppino, and an espresso following the meal. Other of my favorites are the veal scallopini, osso bucco, and pastas. Table linens, fabric napkins, plate service, nice glasses for drinks, clean bathrooms, all help make it feel like an excellent value. It is also a great location next to the Bellevue Park for a walk after the meal.', 'We live in the neighborhood, and bring along our older Labrador, Bleu, to enjoy the patio with us.  He just loves to watch the movement and enjoy his special water he receives from the staff.  The food, service, wine list, cocktails are alway excellent and on point.

A must visit when in the Bellevue area.', 'No one in my party had dined here prior including myself. What a great find this was.

Freshness lacking', 'We had a great meal and great service.  I would highly recommend this spot', 'This restaurant was on my list for long but hard to find last minute reservations as it’s always busy. But honestly it’s overhyped and overpriced.

It feels like a special place to be. The indoor/outdoor flow is really nice. It is very open and airy inside. The service here is very good. Lots of attention to detail. The food is solid. I wouldn't say it's outstanding, but for the volume that they are doing, it is really good. I've eaten good things here before, but this time I didn't like what I ordered at all. A filet mignon salad. It was the special and it had both blue cheese and radicchio in it, making it super bitter and almost inedible. My daughter and mother-in-law liked their halibut and cannelloni very much. Overall, really nice restaurant to celebrate or just have a nice meal.\", 'Wonderful food, wine, and cocktails.

Whether you are there for a special occasion or dinner with friends, your dinner is exceptional.\", 'My recent anniversary celebration at Carmine’s was a disappointing experience.\\nFirst and foremost, despite making an reservation and mentioning our anniversary, we were assigned a table that was located right next to the corner of a busy street during the rush hour. The noise from passing cars, pedestrians, and the smell of gas made it impossible to enjoy my meal. When I requested a different table, the host said all tables are reserved and this table has more privacy. Seriously???? There were plenty of empty tables throughout our entire dinner, which made the seating situation even more frustrating.\\nThe quality of the food was underwhelming. It appeared as though I was served leftovers rather than freshly prepared dishes. The bread was hard and dry. A lot of online reviews had praised complimentary anniversary or birthday dessert, but we left without any such dessert. Honestly, based on my experience, I can’t recommend this overrated & overpriced restaurant to anyone.', 'Loved the food, atmosphere and service.  Great experience!  Thank you!', \"Always a delightful experience. The service, food, and atmosphere are top-notch.

We had the burrata appetizer with arugula with fig balsamic and cherry tomatoes to start, it was so fresh and delicious. We split the Filetto con gnocchi and the risotto with crab, mushrooms and truffle oil (so decadent), but the real star of the meal for us was the steak—it melted in our mouths. Loved the gnocchi and veggies it came with too.

The bar drink (Gunsmoke Manhattan) was great, the wines by the glass to follow excellent with our meals.  The sautéed spinach is a tour de force every time, the warm bread and butter a guilty pleasure.  We split “cups” of the minestrone soup which is portioned like a bowl and tastes like it was delivered from a fresh vegetable garden.  The venison ravioli with spinach and mushrooms was outstanding.

Thanks for an awesome dinner!', 'A perfect evening✨', 'Honestly, for having made a reservation in advanced for our anniversary, I was disappointed to be sat in the middle of a ton of commotion, and honestly while the food was decent, for the price I had higher expectations. I wouldn’t recommend this place, which is unfortunate because it seems as though it could be a promising atmosphere.', 'The main problem with this restaurant is that it is simply not a place to go to have a nice relaxing meal.  The tables are packed together but the main problem is the extraordinarily high noise level.  We were a table of 4 and most of the time could not hear what each other was saying.  The waiter could barely hear the order.  People at other tables were all similarly yelling to be heard.  The restaurant has many hard surfaces and could easily improve the sound situation by adding some sound absorbing materials as many other restaurants do.  The food is quite good and the service professional but there are many other more relaxing options for Italian food.', 'Excellent food, atmosphere, and staff.  Britney was great!', 'Very enjoyable experience, The food taste, quality and quantity were excellent accompanied with outstanding service.  Tables comfortably spaced giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy both their meals and company. Fully occupied for a Saturday evening dinner creating a moderate but comfortable noise level. Food menu prices reasonably on the high side. Extensive wine menu but with unreasonably high prices compared to comparable restaurants in the area.', 'It was fabulous!!!!!', 'Celebrating our 46th Anniversary', 'Service was very attentive.  Veal scallopini and veal chop were well prepared.  The Caesar dressing was tasty. Valet parking appreciated.', 'A wonderful evening.  A lovely setting.  Carmines is nestled within a lovely tree lined neighborhood adjacent to Bellevue Park.  Our server Bethany was excellent, very personable and attentive.  The food was excellent.  Specifically, the Gnocchi, Rigatoni Bolognese, and Squid Ink Capellini were delicious.  Tiramisu and Red Velvet Cake finished the evening nicely.  Will happily return.', 'A great place to take someone who you are trying to treat. Loved their spumoni ice-cream and bread.', 'I was there with a friend for my birthday. The food was nice and the service was superb, definitely recommend!', 'Very good food with the exception of a limpid Caesar salad. This is a pricey restaurant which is OK but the entree food portions are very small.', 'We had a wonderful time at Carmines for my birthday.  Excellent service, delicious food, the best Lemon Drop ever.  Definitely a return visit is in the cards.', 'Carmine’s never disappoints!', 'Great, as always!', \"Great attention to details!  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted in a respectful and friendly manner.  We got an awesome table near the patio door so the wind was able to blow through during the warm evening.  The wine list was extensive and somewhat intimidating if you didn't know your Italian wines.  Our server, Sossity, was very helpful in choosing a wine based on our preferences, but not an overly pricey choice.  All the food was amazing!  We were visiting from out of town, but we will be back in the future!\", \"Jesse was our waiter and did a terrific job!  The food was perfect as always.

The sever was super nice and very attentive.  The food was delicious.', 'a most wonderful chicken salad and Jesse was terrific. four of us celebrate each of our birthdays here', 'Wine was tasty food was really good and the service was nice. The only reason they didn’t get a five star is because the server forgot about us and we had only had bread and water for the first 30 minutes. We had a late reservation and the restaurant was cleaning up for the night so it’s not a big deal. I would have rated 4.5 stars if possible.', \"The food is wonderful and the service impeccable. I especially like to eat al fresco. It's so pretty outside! One comment: way too much salad dressing! Next time, I'll order the dressing on the side.\", \"Had lunch at Carmine's, eat there at least once a month.  Excellent service and very good food.\", 'Excellent service and delicious food.

Wish it was a little quieter but we did sit near the kitchen.', 'For starters we ordered the Burrata with vegetables, it was okay. \\nThe Calamari Fritti was delish, would definitely recommend that as a starter. \\nFor mains we ordered the meat special of the day, Porter House. The steak was good, the mushroom vinaigrette sauce a little too sweet for me. We also ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese which is very delightful.', \"We always enjoy Carmine's.  My only complaint over the years is that the cushions on the dining chairs are two soft.  They seem to be sinking with age and need to be replaced!\", 'Food was excellent, generous portions, attentive and engaging wait staff.

Highly recommend the Carmine's dining experience.\", 'Alwaya fabulous service and food.', 'This was a great place for any occasion.

Our server was friendly and had good suggestions for our dinner.', 'Great location, setting and food.  Wonderful service.', 'Great.

Also a nice place for a girlfriends lunch or dinner.', 'Very good, but very loud!', 'The website offered valet parking for lunch and dinner. We were there for lunch, and expected it.

I suggested that it be corrected; but, it did not seem too important to her!', \"Carmine's is ALWAYS good...good food, great service, full wine list. We have been there many times and always enjoy. This time, however, through no fault of the wait staff, the kitchen got backed up and it took longer than normal to serve us. The waiter did keep us apprised of the situation.\", 'Such a beautiful venue and experience. Have always had the best time, great wine and exceptional service. Can’t wait for our next visit! \\n\\nThank you for making our anniversary so special!', 'Great visit Saturday evening.  Food was really good and the service was prompt and friendly.  I took off one star for service as I feel we were misled on both an entree order and a glass of wine.  For the entree issue, my friend could not decide between 2 dishes so the waiter said he would give her half of each.  She was charged for 2 small portions instead, which came out around $7 more than getting just a large.  We did not complain as she did get 2 smalls and paid for 2 smalls, but that was not the assumption.  The wine issue… a friend wanted a good Italian wine and the waiter said he would get her something good.  So he picked the highest priced glass of barolo.  I think if she knew the price she would not have ordered that, but he did not give her any choice.  Again, she got what she paid for, so no issue with that, it’s just kind of an underhanded upsell.  Still would highly recommend the restaurant, just be clear what you want to order and what you’ll pay.  Several visits here and this was the first issue we had, so you should be fine.', 'One of the best Italian restaurants I’ve been to!!', 'Great calamari and service.', 'Amazing food and service.  carmine’s does not disappoint!  My go to for a long leisurely lunch with my bestie.  We had calamari which was delicious and tender. Lovely ceasar salad, perfectly dressed. And lovely fresh pasta….to die for.

One of my favorite restaurants.', 'Food was outstanding!!!', \"Carmine's is a must do experience. Never disappointed in all the years we have been going. Both Seattle and Bellevue.\\nThe only difference between the 2 is the noise level in Bellevue is way too high. Seattle seems more calm. However, I will still go to Bellevue. It's a winner.\", 'Fantastic service and food.  Expensive, but the presentations and tastes were amazing.  VERY loud, however, which brings the experience down a notch.  All in all, a great place to go and repeat going!', 'Celebrated an anniversary at Carmines.

Our server was top notch, anticipating our needs and very attentive given the busy dinner hour. Made reservations well in advance. Enjoyed a great bruschetta to share for 4 of us with plenty to go around—the salmon was the best on this trio. No complaints from us on our salads and entrees—halibut special was piccata style and beautifully presented. Coolked to perfection. Loved the bread pudding for the grand finale. Hope to be back soon.', 'We were really looking forward to celebrating my husband’s birthday here. We have been here a few times and really enjoyed it and the service was always on point but unfortunately this time was a let down. In the past they have had a cute happy birthday card but maybe that’s not a thing anymore. Server was nice but was missing most of the time and didn’t come over often. Our plates were being cleared in a rush before we were done with our appetizer. We didn’t even bother staying for dessert this time. Overall the food was good but the experience for the price wasn’t worth it.', \"Beautiful setting outside with outstanding meal.  Our table had appetizers, hot and cold entrees and all were served at the right temperature with no shortcuts for lunch selections.  Always dependable - one of my favorite go-to's!\", 'Best food and service.  Thank you', 'Again my wife and I greatly enjoyed each item we ordered. We will continue to visit for special occasions.

Lemon meringue dessert was fabulous!', \"We are regular patrons of Carmine's because the food is always  very good.  This time the lunch entrees were mediocre.

Challenging at times with the noise level, but we managed.  Wonderful selection on the menu and quality excellent.', 'Excellent all around. Some of the best Italian food I have had outside of Italy.', 'The woman who greeted us and sat us at our table was below what we expected. She would not smile and appeared stressed or she didn\\'t want to be there. I asked her if she had a good day, and all I got was \"it was ok\". For the amount of money that we spent on our fabulous dinner, I was shocked to get such a cold shoulder from someone who sat us for our 23rd wedding anniversary. It just set the mood wrong for the rest of the dinner.\\nBut our waiter was fantastic and food was beyond our expectations. Fried Calamari, Rack of Lamb and Oso Bucco were by far the best we have ever had! We will be back!', 'This place is very noisy. Carmines downtown  has a much quieter ambiance. Makes for better experience. They could put up something for sound attenuation which would make it more pleasant.', \"After checking the menu, we asked about the soup, risotto, and fish specials.

As typical, folks can be pretty boisterous during such events and the bleedover of noise was unpleasant and disruptive.\", 'Food was amazing.

It is now the equal to Il Terazzo Carmine in Seattle (owned and operated by Carmine) father of the boys who now run Carmines.

Only thing I didn’t love is that we were crammed into a tiny table that seemed like an afterthought in the dining room and it kept getting jostled by people walking by', 'Carmine\\'s Bellevue is awesome - I highly recommend it. The only \"less than perfect\" aspect is that the garage operator needs to do some serious improvement with their gate system and communication with their staff member when the exit kiosk doesn\\'t honor the parking validation.

Warmest ever greeting and reservation scheduling with super star Tasha.  Top lunch spot for business, friendship and celebrations.  Thank you to the entire family at Carmines!', \"Came to celebrate a birthday.   Place was popping so very loud, could barely hear our waiter.  We ordered an appetizer but that was apparently skipped over.  Two croutons on salad?  Weird.  Filet was poorly seasoned, almost bland.  Cioppino was bland as well.   Shrimp was overcooked and not edible.   Second time dining here and service and food hasn't changed since the last time I visited.  Definitely not worth the price tag.\", 'The dining experience was excellent. For us, the noise level, though energetic, was quite loud making conversation difficult.', 'My girlfriend and I went to Carmine’s for our anniversary. It was the best experience.

Service always impeccable!  Food always delicious!  Even though I live in Seattle, the trek to Bellevue is always  worth it knowing the destination is Carmine’s!', 'It is hard to fully capture the ambiance of Carmines in words. I think the best way I can do it justice is saying there is charisma in the air. Everything is white linen. There is laughter and a level of joy in the air. Everyone who works here feels less like staff and more like family. There is a genuine and warm smile on the bartender, Kelen. There is an unparalleled wine knowledge and kind demeanor from the wine director, Alfredo. And the boss, Adrian, comes by to make sure you are doing ok and can make anything happen for you. Even waiters from previous visits remember you. Paulo is the kindest man I have ever met. I eat out a lot at a lot of high end restaurants every day. Carmines is one of the few restaurants I would still describe as an experience. At the end of the day, it continues to be the best on a consistent basis over anywhere else. I highly recommend the crispy calamari for an appetizer. The duck has the best cherry sauce on it I have ever tasted. For dessert I like the tiramisu! Drink wise they have a huge wine selection. For a cocktail I love the ananas. It is Titos that has been infused in pineapples for 30 days straight. Then it is shaken in a cocktail shaker and poured out for you. Amazing!', 'Fantastic, The best Italian restaurant in Bellevue WA.', 'Consistently great food & service. Very busy lunch rush, but everything was great!', 'I am never disappointed when I visit Carmines in Bellevue. I have visited Carmines on several occasions and each time I am impressed by the service and commitment to detail.

Because this establishment is so busy, I only get this experience 4 or 5 times a year.', 'Delicious food as always!!  Insalata di Maria’s grilled salmon is excellent!

We always have great service & the food is always great & consistent. Everything is always perfect.', \"Always love coming here. The risotto and rigatoni bolognese were excellent as usual. My husband has the prime beef tenderloin with gnocchi and the beef was superb, better than the steak restaurants, but the gnocchi and green beans were over-cooked. Gnocchi was mushy so we didn't eat those and the green beans were soft and not crunchy. I would still go back.\", 'I was surprised when we were told that people with a reservation were now waiting for our table and basically we needed to pack up. We were just about ready to leave but it was not what I would have expected at Carmine’s', 'Love it always.', 'It was quiet at first then got noisier as the night wore on. Very attentive service, nice ambience, great drinks and deliciously prepared food. Definitely will be back next time we are in the area.', 'I’ve been here 3 times in the last month. By far some of the best service I’ve received in Bellevue. All 3 times I had incredible servers/bartenders, who you can tell love what they do. They were incredibly kind, honestly hilarious and truly cared about your experience. The espresso martinis are incredible, their pasta is great, and their spinach ricotta stuffed chicken was sooo good! They have a lemon dessert that literally melts in your mouth, the freshest lemon taste honestly. They also have a bread pudding that has chocolate chips instead of raisins (who likes raisins?) so that made me happy! Come here.', \"Took my grandma out to Carmines for her birthday. We loved it. We arrived at 5pm right when it opened so it was still quiet and only later did it get more noisy. The service was amazing. We were served by a kind blonde woman who was very good at what she does.

It is the first week that the pandemic mask mandate has been lifted and may have explained why every table was full.  The tables were very close to each other, and it was very difficult to have a conversation due to the noise of a full, busy restaurant. If you want a quiet personal dinner, this is not the place to go, but otherwise, I would recommend it.', 'Always amazing, staff is always amazing, what can I say the restaurant is always amazing I have never been disappointed I’m a regular.', 'Wonderful food and ambiance and service was fantastic!

We ordered the mushroom risotto and shrimp pesto pasta, they were both excellent!  The panzanella salad was ok, I think they forgot dressing and not much bread. We had to ask for a basket of bread and for drink refills.  We felt like we were an afterthought.  Maybe they were setting up for dinner?  The service definitely wasn’t the best that I have had. Disappointed!', 'I brought a good friend of mine to the restaurant for her birthday lunch.  Unfortunately she had ordered the clams with Linguine meal and it had sand in the clams, which she realized as she took her first bite of her meal.  I felt bad, but do realize that sometimes this type of thing to happen, but I was sorry it happened to the birthday girl!  She then ordered the Eggplant Parmesan which she enjoyed very much.   I have brought many people to the restaurant in the past and have never had a problem and just hope we will not have that problem again.', 'The food is above average.

Coming from the east coast I more than appreciate a good Italian meal. Carmine's does not disappoint in that regard. The Eggplant Parm as an appetizer is about as good as it gets. Last night I had the Osso Bucco which is one of the many fine choices on the menu. Have a nice bottle of wine with your meal and when you get the check, you at least feel the meal was was the price. As an fyi, the liquor as in most restaurants is what jacks the price up but this is a business so expect the added expense.\", 'Always fantastic love \\nthe ambience especially in the bar \\nfood can’t be beat and of course the company was stellar❗️', 'Celebrated anniversary in great style.

Made it very difficult for those seated on the booth section to exit/enter the space.  Plus the large cushions on the corner added to the challenge. For this size party, booking so far in advance, a free standing table would have been  much better.

I left 80% of the lamb on the plate because it was not the quality I expected. I don’t know if it was the lamb or the cook but it’s made me question ordering the non-pasta items there.', 'The salmon and pizza were excellent, the tenderloin was just okay for the price, especially when there are a dozen excellent steak restaurants in the area. It is indeed super loud in the restaurant. The patio looked adorable and cozy but was filled. The waiter had a bit of an attitude when the steak needed to be sent back as we ordered it between medium and medium-rare and it was literally almost raw.

The service was incredibly slow and somewhat rude. When we first sat down and ordered our drinks (wine), we received one glass that wasn't what we ordered. It was an $18 glass of wine. When we said we didn't like it, we were just told that that's what they have. We didn't even feel like we could order a different glass. Then during the meal, we were never asked if we wanted more drinks. Also, our food sat on the table for at least 20 minutes before anybody came and took it or bagged it to go. Then the Birthday dessert came before we were even offered the opportunity to order other desserts for the table. When we did order more, the waiter looked annoyed and told us what we wanted could take 20 minutes so maybe order something different. It almost felt like we were being ignored a little bit. Not great for what you pay to go there. Also, it is incredibly loud in the restaurant.\", 'Everything was great except the driving rain outside.', 'We had a FANTASTIC dinner at Carmine’s.

Did not check for proof of COVID 19 vaccination as they are required to do by law. Tables very close together. Noise level unpleasant.   Food is average northern Italian fare ... very little finesse to the presentation.  Service was poor.  Long wait to get any attention  to start our ordering,  Waiter was rather abrupt,  impatient.  Restaurant was very busy ... seems to be a gold mine so perhaps they don't think they need to try very hard to provide an enjoyable dining experience or be COVID compliant.\", 'Always excellent at Carmine’s.

I read reviews and based on how difficult it was to get reservation I thought this place would blow me away. Oh I was so wrong. I do want to point out the service was good but what disappointed was the food. For the appetizer we got sautéed calamari which was good but nothing that I would rave about. For entree I ordered a duck breast and that is when the meal went wrong. I asked for medium prepared  and what I got is a raw piece of duck breast which tasted like raw meat and was so chewy. Of course my husband told the waiter about  it and they tried to fix it by overcooking the duck to the point it had no juices left and tasted dry and flavorless. It was very disappointing. I couldn’t eat it. And of course they charged me for this expensive entree that I couldn’t eat. To try to make us feel better they didn’t charge us for a desert my husband and I shared.

The service is dreadfully slow, the food just mediocre, and the price very high. My partner had osso bucco and it wasn’t cooked long enough to be tender. I had the bolognese and it legitimately tasted like chef boyardee from my childhood. The bread was good and the Caprese starter too, but short of those items we left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. We likely won’t be back.', 'We were so pleased with the service. We were late due to our poor planning, they were so nice to accommodate us with the same table as we reserved. Our waitress who only works on Monday, was wonderful.  This was such a contrast to the night before at Ascend where we were just a number, our evening ruined by a manager.  We have patronized the Seattle location for years, it is nice to see how customer service has continued at this location.

Highly recommend!', 'Carmines has quickly been the finest place to go to post-covid. The ambiance can only be described as exquisite. I eat out… way too much… and there is just something at Carmines that leaves you with an air of enchantment. The manager, Adrian is the most amazing person you will ever meet! He is the kind of guy that turns a normal day into a special occasion. He makes Carmines go from great to my favorite! Last night I had the good fortune of Coco being our waitress and I felt like we were best friends by the end of the night. She was absolutely phenomenal and treated my friend and I like we were family.  Food wise, if you like duck I highly recommend the duck. It is a delight to the senses with its slight bourbon cherry sauce coating. My second favorite is the filet mignon with gnocchi. I don’t even normally get filets but this one is out of this world. The pine nuts on the top give it a slight crunch that pairs perfectly with the steak. If you are looking for pasta I recommend the gnocchi in brown butter, it is to die for. In terms of drinks you need to try their ananas. It is Titos infused with fresh pineapples for an entire month. There is no vodka flavor, only a refreshing relish of pineapple. If you like mezcal, the mezcal sour is also a joy to the senses! The wine selection is also out of this world. I constantly get a different bottle and am always amazed with the diversity of fantastic wines they have! For dessert my two favorites are the semifreddo (mostly frozen, very rich chocolate) and spumoni ice cream (which has those amazing bourbon cherries on top). This has quickly become my favorite restaurant and I am here far more often than I should admit! I hope you love this place as much as I do!', 'Yummy food, great service!

It's not a big deal as usual, but I felt anxious and frustrated under the coronavirus pandemic. I want him to have good manners to provide food and drink.\", 'Disappointed. Wait was over 30 mins from reservation. One of the dishes had to be sent back (rubbery chilean sea bass). Service from our waiter (sorry I can’t remember her name) save the night.  I understand everyone’s trying to get back on track, and am sure Carmine’s will, eventually.', 'Amazing food in downtown Bellevue with high class table service.', 'The ONLY negative is the missing bar stools, and that is not their fault.', 'It is always a pleasure to eat there. Great staff, great food and \\nalways consistant', 'Overall everything was great!! Interior is beautiful, foods are delicious and perfect service!', \"the restaurant in Bellevue across the street from the city's main park is charming and very European looking. We sat at a secluded table with flowerbed brimming with beautiful plants on one side, and on the other, where we could see a lot of happy beautiful faces in the background, very sweet! Service was impeccable and the food divine. My husband loved his spaghetti --which is high praise  from a man who loves his pasta, and had the proverbial Italian mother who knew how to cook the old fashioned  way. My veal scallopini was everything I could wish for, tender and flavorful, simply amazing! And the prices were very reasonable, another plus!\", 'Fantastic to get back to Carmine’s. All staff was amazing and health protocols were filled to a T. Food was exceptional', 'This place remains one of our very favorite places!  Order the eggplant it’s amazing.....', 'Food was very good and so was the service! Portions were fantastic and we were full from an appetizer, pasta dish, and a steak dish for 2. Everything was very well prepared. We had the mozzarella and tomato basil appetizer, squid ink pasta with mussels and clams, and the Madagascar steak with risotto. We spent just over 100$ but it was well worth it for the occasion we had. Great experience overall!', 'Great food, amazing service. Will definitely come back', 'The service and ambiance is the best in Bellevue and maybe all Puget Sound.  Go to enjoy the food, wine and being alive!', \"I love Carmine's for their food, their service, and the quality of dining experience they provide.\", \"Carmine's is always first rate - one of the things I like about it is they give me complete confidence that we will be taken care of - and we are.   I gave the ambiance 4 stars as it was a bit disconcerting that a % of guests were coming in without masks.  I'm not sure what their policy is but I know what mine is!\", 'The service tonight was sub par. Not the typical Carmine’s experience.  Also, I didn’t like the increased number of people and lack of social distancing.  They have lowered the bar.', 'lovely place for a nice dinner.\\npricey , but very good food .', 'Amazing restaurant, would highly recommend. Delicious food, kind staff. Absolutely beautiful view of park at sunset.', \"What an amazing restaurant. Also very clean,  everyone was wearing a mask and staff had face shields.  The atmosphere was wonderful with the windows open and great views of the park.  The food was perfect and tasted fresh, local and homemade.  We will be back for sure.  The staff was so friendly.  I love that they validate parking as well because that's at least 30 dollars.\", 'Not as much social distancing as I would have expected. Have been to other restaurants and seen more.', 'Carmines never disappoints. Everything was perfect, right down to the firmness of the pasta. By far, my favorite go-to when I want to feel pampered.', 'We had an amazing anniversary at Carmines!', 'Very Italian feeling! We loved spending our anniversary.', 'Great food /. Great service', 'Awesome.  Always the best food and service!', 'Absolutely wonderful!!!\\nThe food is delicious snd the service is warm and professional!!\\nAlways a delight.', 'This was the best overall dinner out in years, started with attentive service and the food was spectacular!!', 'Always always amazing.

That being said, great food, excellent service, nice space, and you don’t leave hungry.', 'The service and food were excellent.', 'one of our favorites 👏', 'Food and service was excellent as always! Enjoyed spending my birthday dinner there!', \"I had a fantastic time here with my date. Out server was fantastic, funny, and easy to talk to. He had amazing timing, bringing out our dishes at great intervals. The food was some of the best I'd had, and I definitely can't wait to come back.\", 'Consistently delicious and great atmosphere. Servers wore shields and tables seemed more distanced.  It was a great first experience out to dinner since the opening of  in-dining restaurants.', 'Incredible experience from start to finish. Love this restaurant', 'Loved it per usual! Awesome experience as always. Best pastas ever', 'You can’t do better than Carmine’s for an authentic Italian meal & a superior experience.', 'Birthday \\n\\nGreat job despite the challenges of COVID-19!', 'Very lovely being back at carmines with it’s wonderful cuisine']\n"

Upon his return to <a href=\"/wiki/British_Raj\" title=\"British Raj\">India</a>, he enrolled at the <a href=\"/wiki/Bombay_High_Court\" title=\"Bombay High Court\">Bombay High Court</a>, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_National_Congress\" title=\"Indian National Congress\">Indian National Congress</a> in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated <a href=\"/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Muslim_unity\" title=\"Hindu–Muslim unity\">Hindu–Muslim unity</a>, helping to shape the 1916 <a href=\"/wiki/Lucknow_Pact\" title=\"Lucknow Pact\">Lucknow Pact</a> between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_Home_Rule_movement\" title=\"Indian Home Rule movement\">All-India Home Rule League</a>, and proposed a <a href=\"/wiki/Fourteen_Points_of_Jinnah\" title=\"Fourteen Points of Jinnah\">fourteen-point constitutional reform plan</a> to safeguard the political rights of <a href=\"/wiki/Muslims\" title=\"Muslims\">Muslims</a> in the <a href=\"/wiki/Indian_subcontinent\" title=\"Indian subcontinent\">Indian subcontinent</a>. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Satyagraha\" title=\"Satyagraha\">satyagraha</a></i>, which he regarded as <a href=\"/wiki/Anarchism\" title=\"Anarchism\">political anarchy</a>.\n",
       "</p><p>By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the <a href=\"/wiki/Islam_in_South_Asia\" title=\"Islam in South Asia\">Muslims of the subcontinent</a> should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they might be reduced to in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the <a href=\"/wiki/Lahore_Resolution\" title=\"Lahore Resolution\">Lahore Resolution</a>, demanding a separate nation for <a href=\"/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India\" title=\"Presidencies and provinces of British India\">Indian</a> Muslims. During the <a href=\"/wiki/World_War_II\" title=\"World War II\">Second World War</a>, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the <a href=\"/wiki/1946_Indian_provincial_elections\" title=\"1946 Indian provincial elections\">provincial elections</a> held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence of a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Hindu\" title=\"Hindu\">Hindu</a>-majority India, and for a predominantly Muslim state of Pakistan.\n",
       "</p><p>As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of <a href=\"/wiki/Muhajir_(Pakistan)\" title=\"Muhajir (Pakistan)\">Muslim migrants</a> who had emigrated from neighbouring <a href=\"/wiki/Dominion_of_India\" title=\"Dominion of India\">India</a> to Pakistan after the <a href=\"/wiki/Partition_of_India\" title=\"Partition of India\">two states' independence</a>, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Several <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah\" title=\"List of things named after Muhammad Ali Jinnah\">universities and public buildings</a> in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.  He is revered in Pakistan as the <i><span title=\"Urdu-language romanization\"><i lang=\"ur-Latn\">Quaid-e-Azam</i></span></i> (\"Great Leader\") and <span title=\"Urdu-language romanization\"><i lang=\"ur-Latn\">Baba-e-Qaum</i></span> (\"<a href=\"/wiki/Father_of_the_Nation\" title=\"Father of the Nation\">Father of the Nation</a>\"). <a href=\"/wiki/Jinnah%27s_Birthday\" title=\"Jinnah's Birthday\">His birthday</a> is also observed as a <a href=\"/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Pakistan\" title=\"Public holidays in Pakistan\">national holiday</a> in the country.

Ahmed further avers that those scholars who have painted the later Jinnah as secular have misread his speeches which, he argues, must be read in the context of Islamic history and culture. Accordingly, Jinnah's imagery of the Pakistan began to become clear that it was to have an Islamic nature. This change has been seen to last for the rest of Jinnah's life. He continued to borrow ideas \"directly from Iqbal—including his thoughts on Muslim unity, on Islamic ideals of liberty, justice and equality, on economics, and even on practices such as prayers\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKarim201026_113-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKarim201026-113\"><span class=\"cite-bracket\">[</span>109<span class=\"cite-bracket\">]</span></a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKhan2010151_104-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKhan2010151-104\"><span class=\"cite-bracket\">[</span>100<span class=\"cite-bracket\">]</span></a></sup>\n",

      "Muhammad Ali Jinnah[a] (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai;[b] 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947 and then as Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.\n",
      "Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.\n",
      "By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they might be reduced to in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence of a Hindu-majority India, and for a predominantly Muslim state of Pakistan.\n",
      "As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.  He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam (\"Great Leader\") and Baba-e-Qaum (\"Father of the Nation\"). His birthday is also observed as a national holiday in the country. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.\n",

      "Portrait of Jinnah's father, Jinnahbhai Poonja\n",
      "Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, and he likely was born in 1876,[c] to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi,[2] now in Sindh, Pakistan, but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather lived in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India).[3][4][5] He himself was a Khoja of Nizari Isma'ili Shia Muslim background from Gujarat, though he later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings.[6] Jinnah would say that his ancestor was a Rajput from Sahiwal in Punjab who moved into Kathiawar after becoming a Khoja.[3] After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the Sunni sect of Islam.[3]\n",
      "Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background. His father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal; his mother was from the nearby village of Dhaffa.[4] They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay.[7][8] Jinnah was the second child;[9] he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah.[10] Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he was more fluent in English.[11][12][13] Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.[14]\n",
      "As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have attended the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh Madressatul Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School.[15][16][17] He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.[18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Education in England\n",
      "Lincoln's Inn, seen in 2006\n",
      "In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate of Jinnahbhai Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London apprenticeship with his firm, Graham's Shipping and Trading Company.[19] He accepted the position despite the opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his junior from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and first wife both died during his absence in England.[20] Although the apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity for Jinnah, one reason for sending him overseas was a legal proceeding against his father, which placed the family's property at risk of being sequestered by the court. In 1893, the Jinnahbhai family moved to Bombay.[15]\n",
      "Soon after his arrival in London, Jinnah gave up the business apprenticeship in order to study law, enraging his father, who had, before his departure, given him enough money to live for three years. The aspiring barrister joined Lincoln's Inn, later stating that the reason he chose Lincoln's over the other Inns of Court was that over the main entrance to Lincoln's Inn were the names of the world's great lawgivers, including Muhammad. Jinnah's biographer Stanley Wolpert notes that there is no such inscription, but inside is a mural showing Muhammad and other lawgivers, and speculates that Jinnah may have edited the story in his own mind to avoid mentioning a pictorial depiction which would be offensive to many Muslims.[21] Jinnah's legal education followed the pupillage (legal apprenticeship) system, which had been in force there for centuries. To gain knowledge of the law, he followed an established barrister and learned from what he did, as well as from studying lawbooks.[22]  During this period, he shortened his name to Muhammad Ali Jinnah.[23]\n",
      "During his student years in England, Jinnah was influenced by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders. His main intellectual references were peoples like Bentham, Mill, Spencer, and Comte.[24][25] This political education included exposure to the idea of the democratic nation, and progressive politics.[26] He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.[27][28]\n",
      "\n",
      "Jinnah wearing a suit\n",
      "The Western world not only inspired Jinnah in his political life, but also greatly influenced his personal preferences, particularly when it came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public. He came to own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with detachable collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the same silk tie twice.[29]  Even when he was dying, he insisted on being formally dressed, \"I will not travel in my pyjamas.\"[14] In his later years he was usually seen wearing a Karakul hat which subsequently came to be known as the \"Jinnah cap\".[30]\n",
      "Dissatisfied with the law, Jinnah briefly embarked on a stage career with a Shakespearean company, but resigned after receiving a stern letter from his father.[31] In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest British Indian to be called to the bar in England.[9] Although he returned to Karachi, he remained there only a short time before moving to Bombay.[31]\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal and early political career\n",
      "Barrister\n",
      "Jinnah as a barrister\n",
      "At the age of 20, Jinnah began his practice in Bombay, the only Muslim barrister in the city.[9] English had become his principal language and would remain so throughout his life. His first three years in the law, from 1897 to 1900, brought him few briefs. His first step towards a brighter career occurred when the acting Advocate General of Bombay, John Molesworth MacPherson, invited Jinnah to work from his chambers.[32][33] In 1900, P. H. Dastoor, a Bombay presidency magistrate, left the post temporarily and Jinnah succeeded in getting the interim position. After his six-month appointment period, Jinnah was offered a permanent position on a 1,500 rupee per month salary. Jinnah politely declined the offer, stating that he planned to earn 1,500 rupees a day—a huge sum at that time—which he eventually did.[32][33][34]  Nevertheless, as Governor-General of Pakistan, he would refuse to accept a large salary, fixing it at 1 rupee per month.[35]\n",
      "As a lawyer, Jinnah gained fame for his skilled handling of the 1908 \"Caucus Case\". This controversy arose out of Bombay municipal elections, which Indians alleged were rigged by a \"caucus\" of Europeans to keep Sir Pherozeshah Mehta out of the council.[36] Jinnah gained great esteem from leading the case for Sir Pherozeshah, himself a noted barrister. It was after his case that Jinnah posted a successful record, becoming well known for his advocacy and legal logic.[37] In 1908, his factional foe in the Indian National Congress, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, was arrested for sedition. Before Tilak unsuccessfully represented himself at trial, he engaged Jinnah in an attempt to secure his release on bail. Jinnah did not succeed, but obtained an acquittal for Tilak when he was charged with sedition again in 1916.[38]\n",
      "One of Jinnah's fellow barristers from the Bombay High Court remembered that \"Jinnah's faith in himself was incredible\"; he recalled that on being admonished by a judge with \"Mr. Jinnah, remember that you are not addressing a third-class magistrate\", Jinnah shot back, \"My Lord, allow me to warn you that you are not addressing a third-class pleader.\"[39]  Another of his fellow barristers described him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      " He was what God made him, a great pleader. He had a sixth sense: he could see around corners. That is where his talents lay ... he was a very clear thinker ... But he drove his points home—points chosen with exquisite selection—slow delivery, word by word.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade unionist\n",
      "Jinnah was also a supporter of working class causes and an active trade unionist.[41] He was elected President of All India Postal Staff Union in 1925 whose membership was 70,000.[41] According to All Pakistan Labour Federation's publication Productive Role of Trade Unions and Industrial Relations, being a member of Legislative Assembly, Jinnah pleaded forcefully for rights of workers and struggled for getting a \"living wage and fair conditions\" for them.[42] He also played an important role in enactment of Trade Union Act of 1926 which gave trade union movement legal cover to organise themselves.[42]\n",

      "Jinnah in 1910\n",
      "In 1857, many Indians had risen in revolt against British rule. In the aftermath of the conflict, some Anglo-Indians, as well as Indians in Britain, called for greater self-government for the subcontinent, resulting in the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Most founding members had been educated in Britain, and were content with the minimal reform efforts being made by the government.[43] Muslims were not enthusiastic about calls for democratic institutions in British India, as they constituted a quarter to a third of the population, outnumbered by the Hindus.[44] Early meetings of the Congress contained a minority of Muslims, mostly from the elite.[45]\n",
      "Jinnah devoted much of his time to his law practice in the early 1900s, but remained politically involved. Jinnah began political life by attending the Congress's twentieth annual meeting, in Bombay in December 1904.[46] He was a member of the moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale.[47] They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, who sought quick action towards independence.[48]  In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders, known as the Simla Delegation, headed by the Aga Khan called on the new Viceroy of India, Lord Minto, to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the \"unsympathetic [Hindu] majority\".[49]  Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper Gujarati, asking what right the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed.[47]  When many of the same leaders met in Dacca in December of that year to form the All-India Muslim League to advocate for their community's interests, Jinnah was again opposed. The Aga Khan later wrote that it was \"freakishly ironic\" that Jinnah, who would lead the League to independence, \"came out in bitter hostility toward all that I and my friends had done ... He said that our principle of separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself.\"[50]  In its earliest years, however, the League was not influential; Minto refused to consider it as the Muslim community's representative, and it was ineffective in preventing the 1911 repeal of the partition of Bengal, an action seen as a blow to Muslim interests.[51]\n",
      "Although Jinnah initially opposed separate electorates for Muslims, he used this means to gain his first elective office in 1909, as Bombay's Muslim representative on the Imperial Legislative Council. He was a compromise candidate when two older, better-known Muslims who were seeking the post deadlocked. The council, which had been expanded to 60 members as part of reforms enacted by Minto, recommended legislation to the Viceroy. Only officials could vote in the council; non-official members, such as Jinnah, had no vote. Throughout his legal career, Jinnah practised probate law (with many clients from India's nobility), and in 1911 introduced the Wakf Validation Act to place Muslim religious trusts on a sound legal footing under British Indian law. Two years later, the measure passed, the first act sponsored by non-officials to pass the council and be enacted by the Viceroy.[52][53] Jinnah was also appointed to a committee which helped to establish the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun.[54]\n",
      "In December 1912, Jinnah addressed the annual meeting of the Muslim League although he was not yet a member. He joined the following year, although he remained a member of the Congress as well and stressed that League membership took second priority to the \"greater national cause\" of an independent India. In April 1913, he again went to Britain, with Gokhale, to meet with officials on behalf of the Congress. Gokhale, a Hindu, later stated that Jinnah \"has true stuff in him, and that freedom from all sectarian prejudice which will make him the best ambassador of Hindu–Muslim Unity\".[55] Jinnah led another delegation of the Congress to London in 1914, but due to the start of the First World War in August 1914, found officials little interested in Indian reforms. By coincidence, he was in Britain at the same time as a man who would become his great political rival, Mohandas Gandhi, a Hindu lawyer who had become well known for advocating satyagraha, non-violent non-co-operation, while in South Africa. Jinnah attended a reception for Gandhi where the two men met and talked with each other for the first time. Shortly afterwards, Jinnah returned home to India in January 1915.[56]\n",
      "\n",
      "Farewell to Congress\n",
      "Jinnah's moderate faction in the Congress was undermined by the deaths of Mehta and Gokhale in 1915; he was further isolated by the fact that Naoroji was in London, where he remained until his death in 1917.  Nevertheless, Jinnah worked to bring the Congress and League together. In 1916, with Jinnah now president of the Muslim League, the two organisations signed the Lucknow Pact, setting quotas for Muslim and Hindu representation in the various provinces. Although the pact was never fully implemented, its signing ushered in a period of co-operation between the Congress and the League.[57][45]\n",
      "During the war, Jinnah joined other Indian moderates in supporting the British war effort, hoping that Indians would be rewarded with political freedoms. Jinnah played an important role in the founding of the All India Home Rule League in 1916. Along with political leaders Annie Besant and Tilak, Jinnah demanded \"home rule\" for India—the status of a self-governing dominion in the Empire similar to Canada, New Zealand and Australia, although, with the war, Britain's politicians were not interested in considering Indian constitutional reform. British Cabinet minister Edwin Montagu recalled Jinnah in his memoirs, \"young, perfectly mannered, impressive-looking, armed to the teeth with dialectics, and insistent on the whole of his scheme\".[58]\n",
      "In 1918, Jinnah married his second wife Rattanbai Petit (\"Ruttie\"), 24 years his junior. She was the fashionable young daughter of his friend Sir Dinshaw Petit, and was part of an elite Parsi family of Bombay.[26] There was great opposition to the marriage from Rattanbai's family and the Parsi community, as well as from some Muslim religious leaders. Rattanbai defied her family and nominally converted to Islam, adopting (though never using) the name Maryam Jinnah, resulting in a permanent estrangement from her family and Parsi society. The couple resided at South Court Mansion in Bombay, and frequently travelled across India and Europe. The couple's only child, daughter Dina, was born on 15 August 1919.[26] The couple separated prior to Ruttie's death in 1929, and subsequently Jinnah's sister Fatima looked after him and his child.[59]\n",
      "Relations between Indians and British were strained in 1919 when the Imperial Legislative Council extended emergency wartime restrictions on civil liberties; Jinnah resigned from it when it did. There was unrest across India, which worsened after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, in which British Indian Army troops fired upon a protest meeting, killing hundreds. In the wake of Amritsar, Gandhi, who had returned to India and become a widely respected leader and highly influential in the Congress, called for satyagraha against the British. Gandhi's proposal gained broad Hindu support, and was also attractive to many Muslims of the Khilafat faction. These Muslims, supported by Gandhi, sought retention of the Ottoman caliphate, which supplied spiritual leadership to many Muslims. The caliph was the Ottoman Emperor, who would be deprived of both offices following his nation's defeat in the First World War. Gandhi had achieved considerable popularity among Muslims because of his work during the war on behalf of killed or imprisoned Muslims.[60][61][62] Unlike Jinnah and other leaders of the Congress, Gandhi did not wear western-style clothing, did his best to use an Indian language instead of English, and was deeply rooted in Indian culture. Gandhi's local style of leadership gained great popularity with the Indian people. Jinnah criticised Gandhi's Khilafat advocacy, which he saw as an endorsement of religious zealotry.[63] Jinnah regarded Gandhi's proposed satyagraha campaign as political anarchy, and believed that self-government should be secured through constitutional means. He opposed Gandhi, but the tide of Indian opinion was against him. At the 1920 session of the Congress in Nagpur, Jinnah was shouted down by the delegates, who passed Gandhi's proposal, pledging satyagraha until India was independent. Jinnah did not attend the subsequent League meeting, held in the same city, which passed a similar resolution. Because of the action of the Congress in endorsing Gandhi's campaign, Jinnah resigned from it, leaving all positions except in the Muslim League.[64][65]\n",

      "The alliance between Gandhi and the Khilafat faction did not last long, and the campaign of resistance proved less effective than hoped, as India's institutions continued to function. Jinnah sought alternative political ideas, and contemplated organising a new political party as a rival to the Congress. In September 1923, Jinnah was elected as Muslim member for Bombay in the new Central Legislative Assembly. He showed much skill as a parliamentarian, organising many Indian members to work with the Swaraj Party, and continued to press demands for full responsible government. In 1925, as recognition for his legislative activities, he was offered a knighthood by Lord Reading, who was retiring from the Viceroyalty. He replied: \"I prefer to be plain Mr Jinnah.\"[66]\n",
      "In 1927, the British Government, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, undertook a decennial review of Indian policy mandated by the Government of India Act 1919.  The review began two years early as Baldwin feared he would lose the next election (which he did, in 1929). The Cabinet was influenced by minister Winston Churchill, who strongly opposed self-government for India, and members hoped that by having the commission appointed early, the policies for India which they favoured would survive their government. The resulting commission, led by Liberal MP John Simon, though with a majority of Conservatives, arrived in India in March 1928.[67] They were met with a boycott by India's leaders, Muslim and Hindu alike, angered at the British refusal to include their representatives on the commission.  A minority of Muslims, though, withdrew from the League, choosing to welcome the Simon Commission and repudiating Jinnah.  Most members of the League's executive council remained loyal to Jinnah, attending the League meeting in December 1927 and January 1928 which confirmed him as the League's permanent president. At that session, Jinnah told the delegates that \"A constitutional war has been declared on Great Britain. Negotiations for a settlement are not to come from our side ... By appointing an exclusively white Commission, [Secretary of State for India] Lord Birkenhead has declared our unfitness for self-government.\"[68]\n",
      "Birkenhead in 1928 challenged Indians to come up with their own proposal for constitutional change for India; in response, the Congress convened a committee under the leadership of Motilal Nehru.[1] The Nehru Report favoured constituencies based on geography on the ground that being dependent on each other for election would bind the communities closer together. Jinnah, though he believed separate electorates, based on religion, necessary to ensure Muslims had a voice in the government, was willing to compromise on this point, but talks between the two parties failed.  He put forth proposals that he hoped might satisfy a broad range of Muslims and reunite the League, calling for mandatory representation for Muslims in legislatures and cabinets. These became known as his Fourteen Points. He could not secure adoption of the Fourteen Points, as the League meeting in Delhi at which he hoped to gain a vote instead dissolved into chaotic argument.[69]\n",
      "After Baldwin was defeated at the 1929 British parliamentary election, Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Party became prime minister. MacDonald desired a conference of Indian and British leaders in London to discuss India's future, a course of action supported by Jinnah. Three Round Table Conferences followed over as many years, none of which resulted in a settlement.  Jinnah was a delegate to the first two conferences, but was not invited to the last.[70]  He remained in Britain for most of the period 1930 through 1934, practising as a barrister before the Privy Council, where he dealt with a number of India-related cases. His biographers disagree over why he remained so long in Britain—Wolpert asserts that had Jinnah been made a Law Lord, he would have stayed for life, and that Jinnah alternatively sought a parliamentary seat.[71][72]  Early biographer Hector Bolitho denied that Jinnah sought to enter the British Parliament,[71] while Jaswant Singh deems Jinnah's time in Britain as a break or sabbatical from the Indian struggle.[73]  Bolitho called this period \"Jinnah's years of order and contemplation, wedged in between the time of early struggle, and the final storm of conquest\".[74]\n",
      "In 1931, Fatima Jinnah joined her brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Ali Jinnah would receive personal care and support from her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would eventually kill him. She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Parsi, Neville Wadia from a prominent business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded him that he had married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, and she did not come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.[75][76]\n",

      "Return to politics\n",
      "The early 1930s saw a resurgence in Indian Muslim nationalism, which came to a head with the Pakistan Declaration.  In 1933, Indian Muslims, especially from the United Provinces, began to urge Jinnah to return and take up again his leadership of the Muslim League, an organisation which had fallen into inactivity.[77] He remained titular president of the League,[d] but declined to travel to India to preside over its 1933 session in April, writing that he could not possibly return there until the end of the year.[78]\n",
      "Among those who met with Jinnah to seek his return was Liaquat Ali Khan, who would be a major political associate of Jinnah in the years to come and the first prime minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah.[79][80] In early 1934, Jinnah relocated to the subcontinent, though he shuttled between London and India on business for the next few years, selling his house in Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.[81][82]\n",
      "Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then absent in London, as their representative to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934.[83][84] The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over such matters as foreign policy, defence, and much of the budget. Full power remained in the hands of the Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much better prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.[85]\n",

      "Jinnah (front, left) with the Working Committee of the Muslim League after a meeting in Lucknow, October 1937\n",
      "According to Jaswant Singh, \"the events of 1937 had a tremendous, almost a traumatic effect upon Jinnah\".[86] Despite his beliefs of twenty years that Muslims could protect their rights in a united India through separate electorates, provincial boundaries drawn to preserve Muslim majorities, and by other protections of minority rights, Muslim voters had failed to unite, with the issues Jinnah hoped to bring forward lost amid factional fighting.[86][87] Singh notes the effect of the 1937 elections on Muslim political opinion, \"when the Congress formed a government with almost all of the Muslim MLAs sitting on the Opposition benches, non-Congress Muslims were suddenly faced with this stark reality of near-total political powerlessness. It was brought home to them, like a bolt of lightning, that even if the Congress did not win a single Muslim seat ... as long as it won an absolute majority in the House, on the strength of the general seats, it could and would form a government entirely on its own ...\"[88]\n",
      "In the next two years, Jinnah worked to build support among Muslims for the League. He secured the right to speak for the Muslim-led Bengali and Punjabi provincial governments in the central government in New Delhi (\"the centre\"). He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (1⁄8 of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League along the lines of the Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed.[89] By December 1939, Liaquat estimated that the League had three million two-anna members.[90]\n",

      "Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the British Raj expected, upon independence, to be part of a unitary state encompassing all of British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated self-government.[91] Despite this, other nationalist proposals were being made. In a speech given at Allahabad to a League session in 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal called for a state for Muslims in British India. Choudhary Rahmat Ali published a pamphlet in 1933 advocating a state \"Pakistan\" in the Indus Valley, with other names given to Muslim-majority areas elsewhere in India.[92] Jinnah and Iqbal corresponded in 1936 and 1937; in subsequent years, Jinnah credited Iqbal as his mentor and used Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his speeches.[93]\n",
      "Although many leaders of the Congress sought a strong central government for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, including Jinnah, were unwilling to accept this without powerful protections for their community.[91]  Other Muslims supported the Congress, which officially advocated a secular state upon independence, though the traditionalist wing (including politicians such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Vallabhbhai Patel) believed that an independent India should enact laws such as banning the killing of cows and making Hindi a national language.  The failure of the Congress leadership to disavow Hindu communalists worried Congress-supporting Muslims.  Nevertheless, the Congress enjoyed considerable Muslim support up to about 1937.[94]\n",
      "Events which separated the communities included the failed attempt to form a coalition government including the Congress and the League in the United Provinces following the 1937 election.[95] According to historian Ian Talbot, \"The provincial Congress governments made no effort to understand and respect their Muslim populations' cultural and religious sensibilities. The Muslim League's claims that it alone could safeguard Muslim interests thus received a major boost. Significantly it was only after this period of Congress rule that it [the League] took up the demand for a Pakistan state ...\"[84]\n",
      "Balraj Puri in his journal article about Jinnah suggests that the Muslim League president, after the 1937 vote, turned to the idea of partition in \"sheer desperation\".[96] Historian Akbar S. Ahmed suggests that Jinnah abandoned hope of reconciliation with the Congress as he \"rediscover[ed] his own Islamic roots, his own sense of identity, of culture and history, which would come increasingly to the fore in the final years of his life\".[16] Jinnah also increasingly adopted Muslim dress in the late 1930s.[97] In the wake of the 1937 balloting, Jinnah demanded that the question of power sharing be settled on an all-India basis, and that he, as president of the League, be accepted as the sole spokesman for the Muslim community.[98]\n",

      "The well documented influence of Iqbal on Jinnah, with regard to taking the lead in creating Pakistan, has been described as \"significant\", \"powerful\" and even \"unquestionable\" by scholars.[100][101][102] Iqbal has also been cited as an influential force in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London and re-enter the politics of India.[103][104][105][106] Initially, however, Iqbal and Jinnah were opponents, as Iqbal believed Jinnah did not care about the crises confronting the Muslim community during the British Raj. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, this began to change during Iqbal's final years prior to his death in 1938. Iqbal gradually succeeded in converting Jinnah over to his view, who eventually accepted Iqbal as his mentor. Ahmed comments that in his annotations to Iqbal's letters, Jinnah expressed solidarity with Iqbal's view: that Indian Muslims required a separate homeland.[107]\n",
      "Iqbal's influence also gave Jinnah a deeper appreciation for Muslim identity.[108] The evidence of this influence began to be revealed from 1937 onwards. Jinnah not only began to echo Iqbal in his speeches, he started using Islamic symbolism and began directing his addresses to the underprivileged. Ahmed noted a change in Jinnah's words: while he still advocated freedom of religion and protection of the minorities, the model he was now aspiring to was that of the Prophet Muhammad, rather than that of a secular politician. Ahmed further avers that those scholars who have painted the later Jinnah as secular have misread his speeches which, he argues, must be read in the context of Islamic history and culture. Accordingly, Jinnah's imagery of the Pakistan began to become clear that it was to have an Islamic nature. This change has been seen to last for the rest of Jinnah's life. He continued to borrow ideas \"directly from Iqbal—including his thoughts on Muslim unity, on Islamic ideals of liberty, justice and equality, on economics, and even on practices such as prayers\".[109][100]\n",
      "In a speech in 1940, two years after the death of Iqbal, Jinnah expressed his preference for implementing Iqbal's vision for an Islamic Pakistan even if it meant he himself would never lead a nation. Jinnah stated, \"If I live to see the ideal of a Muslim state being achieved in India, and I was then offered to make a choice between the works of Iqbal and the rulership of the Muslim state, I would prefer the former.\"[110]\n",

      "On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced the commencement of war with Nazi Germany.[111] The following day, the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India. After meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended for the duration of the war.[112] The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate independence with a constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial governments resigned on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder of the war.  Jinnah, on the other hand, was more willing to accommodate the British, and they in turn increasingly recognised him and the League as the representatives of India's Muslims.[113] Jinnah later stated, \"after the war began, ... I was treated on the same basis as Mr Gandhi. I was wonderstruck why I was promoted and given a place side by side with Mr Gandhi.\"[114] Although the League did not actively support the British war effort, neither did they try to obstruct it.[115]\n",

      "Jinnah and Gandhi arguing after a meeting between them in Delhi, November 1939\n",
      "With the British and Muslims to some extent co-operating, the Viceroy asked Jinnah for an expression of the Muslim League's position on self-government, confident that it would differ greatly from that of the Congress. To come up with such a position, the League's Working Committee met for four days in February 1940 to set out terms of reference to a constitutional sub-committee. The Working Committee asked that the sub-committee return with a proposal that would result in \"independent dominions in direct relationship with Great Britain\" where Muslims were dominant.[116]  On 6 February, Jinnah informed the Viceroy that the Muslim League would be demanding partition instead of the federation contemplated in the 1935 Act. The Lahore Resolution (sometimes called the \"Pakistan Resolution\", although it does not contain that name), based on the sub-committee's work, embraced the two-nation theory and called for a union of the Muslim-majority provinces in the northwest of British India, with complete autonomy. Similar rights were to be granted to the Muslim-majority areas in the east, and unspecified protections given to Muslim minorities in other provinces. The resolution was passed by the League session in Lahore on 23 March 1940.[117][118]\n",

      "Jinnah makes a speech in New Delhi, 1943\n",
      "Gandhi's reaction to the Lahore Resolution was muted; he called it \"baffling\", but told his disciples that Muslims, in common with other people of India, had the right to self-determination.  Leaders of the Congress were more vocal; Jawaharlal Nehru referred to Lahore as \"Jinnah's fantastic proposals\" while Chakravarti Rajagopalachari deemed Jinnah's views on partition \"a sign of a diseased mentality\".[119] Linlithgow met with Jinnah in June 1940,[120] soon after Winston Churchill became the British prime minister, and in August offered both the Congress and the League a deal whereby in exchange for full support for the war, Linlithgow would allow Indian representation on his major war councils. The Viceroy promised a representative body after the war to determine India's future, and that no future settlement would be imposed over the objections of a large part of the population. This was satisfactory to neither the Congress nor the League, though Jinnah was pleased that the British had moved towards recognising Jinnah as the representative of the Muslim community's interests.[121] Jinnah was reluctant to make specific proposals as to the boundaries of Pakistan, or its relationships with Britain and with the rest of the subcontinent, fearing that any precise plan would divide the League.[122]\n",

      "Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi in Bombay, September 1944The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 brought the United States into the war. In the following months, the Japanese advanced in Southeast Asia, and the British Cabinet sent a mission led by Sir Stafford Cripps to try to conciliate the Indians and cause them to fully back the war. Cripps proposed giving some provinces what was dubbed the \"local option\" to remain outside of an Indian central government either for a period of time or permanently, to become dominions on their own or be part of another confederation. The Muslim League was far from certain of winning the legislative votes that would be required for mixed provinces such as Bengal and Punjab to secede, and Jinnah rejected the proposals as not sufficiently recognising Pakistan's right to exist. The Congress also rejected the Cripps plan, demanding immediate concessions which Cripps was not prepared to give.[123][124] Despite the rejection, Jinnah and the League saw the Cripps proposal as recognising Pakistan in principle.[125]\n",
      "The Congress followed the failed Cripps mission by demanding, in August 1942, that the British immediately \"Quit India\", proclaiming a mass campaign of satyagraha until they did.  The British promptly arrested most major leaders of the Congress and imprisoned them for the remainder of the war.  Gandhi, however, was placed on house arrest in one of the Aga Khan's palaces prior to his release for health reasons in 1944.  With the Congress leaders absent from the political scene, Jinnah warned against the threat of Hindu domination and maintained his Pakistan demand without going into great detail about what that would entail. Jinnah also worked to increase the League's political control at the provincial level.[126][127]\n",
      "He helped to found the newspaper Dawn in the early 1940s in Delhi; it helped to spread the League's message and eventually became the major English-language newspaper of Pakistan.[128] He also started living in Delhi on Aurangzeb Road (now Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Road), near Birla House where Mahatma Gandhi stayed and Jinnah was neighbours with the wealthiest man in Delhi at the time, Sir Sobha Singh.[129] His house is now the Embassy of Netherlands in India and is known as Jinnah House by most.[130]\n",
      "In September 1944, Jinnah hosted Gandhi, recently released from confinement, at his home on Malabar Hill in Bombay. Two weeks of talks between them followed, which resulted in no agreement. Jinnah insisted on Pakistan being conceded prior to the British departure and to come into being immediately, while Gandhi proposed that plebiscites on partition occur sometime after a united India gained its independence.[131] In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, the Congress and the League should form an interim government with the members of the Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by the Congress and the League in equal numbers. When the Congress leadership were released from prison in June 1945, they repudiated the agreement and censured Desai for acting without proper authority.[132]\n",

In June 1945, following the release of the Congress leaders, Wavell called for a conference, and invited the leading figures from the various communities to meet with him at Simla. He proposed a temporary government along the lines which Liaquat and Desai had agreed. However, Wavell was unwilling to guarantee that only the League's candidates would be placed in the seats reserved for Muslims. All other invited groups submitted lists of candidates to the Viceroy. Wavell cut the conference short in mid-July without further seeking an agreement; with a British general election imminent, Churchill's government did not feel it could proceed.[133]\n",

Attlee and his Secretary of State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered a review of the Indian situation.[134] Jinnah had no comment on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after.

In the provincial elections in January 1946, the League took 75% of the Muslim vote, an increase from 4.4% in 1937.[138] According to his biographer Bolitho, \"This was Jinnah's glorious hour: his arduous political campaigns, his robust beliefs and claims, were at last justified.\"[139] Wolpert wrote that the League election showing \"appeared to prove the universal appeal of Pakistan among Muslims of the subcontinent\".[140] The Congress dominated the central assembly nevertheless, though it lost four seats from its previous strength.[140]\n",

The highest-level delegation to try to break the deadlock, it arrived in New Delhi in late March. Little negotiation had been done since the previous October because of the elections in India.[141] The British in May released a plan for a united Indian state comprising substantially autonomous provinces, and called for \"groups\" of provinces formed on the basis of religion. Matters such as defence, external relations and communications would be handled by a central authority. Provinces would have the option of leaving the union entirely, and there would be an interim government with representation from the Congress and the League. Jinnah and his Working Committee accepted this plan in June, but it fell apart over the question of how many members of the interim government the Congress and the League would have, and over the Congress's desire to include a Muslim member in its representation. Before leaving India, the British ministers stated that they intended to inaugurate an interim government even if one of the major groups was unwilling to participate.[142]\n",
      "The Congress soon joined the new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not entering until October 1946. In agreeing to have the League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid a backdrop of rioting, especially in Calcutta.[143] The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately summon the constituent assembly and begin the work of writing a constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At the end of the talks, participants issued a statement that the constitution would not be forced on any unwilling parts of India.[144] On the way back from London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.[145]\n",
      "The Congress endorsed the joint statement from the London conference over the angry dissent from some elements. The League refused to do so, and took no part in the constitutional discussions.[144] Jinnah had been willing to consider some continued links to Hindustan (as the Hindu-majority state which would be formed on partition was sometimes referred to), such as a joint military or communications. However, by December 1946, he insisted on a fully sovereign Pakistan with dominion status.[146]\n",
      "Following the failure of the London trip, Jinnah was in no hurry to reach an agreement, considering that time would allow him to gain the undivided provinces of Bengal and Punjab for Pakistan, but these wealthy, populous provinces had sizeable non-Muslim minorities, complicating a settlement.[147] The Attlee ministry desired a rapid British departure from the subcontinent, but had little confidence in Wavell to achieve that end. Beginning in December 1946, British officials began looking for a viceregal successor to Wavell, and soon fixed on Admiral Lord Mountbatten of Burma, a war leader popular among Conservatives as the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and among Labour for his political views.[145]\n",

Nehru stated in 1960, \"the truth is that we were tired men and we were getting on in years ... The plan for partition offered a way out and we took it.\"[150]  Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at the centre which they desired.[151] However, the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be divided.[152]\n",
      "Mountbatten had been warned in his briefing papers that Jinnah would be his \"toughest customer\" who had proved a chronic nuisance because \"no one in this country [India] had so far gotten into Jinnah's mind\".[153] The men met over six days beginning on 5 April. The sessions began lightly when Jinnah, photographed between Louis and Edwina Mountbatten, quipped \"A rose between two thorns\" which the Viceroy took, perhaps gratuitously, as evidence that the Muslim leader had pre-planned his joke but had expected the vicereine to stand in the middle.[154] Mountbatten was not favourably impressed with Jinnah, repeatedly expressing frustration to his staff about Jinnah's insistence on Pakistan in the face of all argument.[155]\n",

      "Jinnah feared that at the end of the British presence in the subcontinent, they would turn control over to the Congress-dominated constituent assembly, putting Muslims at a disadvantage in attempting to win autonomy. He demanded that Mountbatten divide the army prior to independence, which would take at least a year. Mountbatten had hoped that the post-independence arrangements would include a common defence force, but Jinnah saw it as essential that a sovereign state should have its own forces. Mountbatten met with Liaquat the day of his final session with Jinnah, and concluded, as he told Attlee and the Cabinet in May, that \"it had become clear that the Muslim League would resort to arms if Pakistan in some form were not conceded.\"[156][157]  The Viceroy was also influenced by negative Muslim reaction to the constitutional report of the assembly, which envisioned broad powers for the post-independence central government.[158]\n",
      "On 2 June 1947, the final plan was given by the Viceroy to Indian leaders: on 15 August, the British would turn over power to two dominions. The provinces would vote on whether to continue in the existing constituent assembly or to have a new one, that is, to join Pakistan. Bengal and Punjab would also vote, both on the question of which assembly to join, and on the partition. A boundary commission would determine the final lines in the partitioned provinces. Plebiscites would take place in the North-West Frontier Province (which did not have a League government despite an overwhelmingly Muslim population), and in the majority-Muslim Sylhet district of Assam, adjacent to eastern Bengal. On 3 June, Mountbatten, Nehru, Jinnah and Sikh leader Baldev Singh made the formal announcement by radio.[159][160][161] Jinnah concluded his address with \"Pakistan Zindabad\" (Long live Pakistan), which was not in the script.[162]\n",
      "Some listeners misunderstood his Urdu as \"Pakistan's in the bag!\".[163]\n",

      "Jinnah announcing the creation of Pakistan over All India Radio on 3 June 1947\n",
      "On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to recommend to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who had hoped to have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten would be likely to favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence.  Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, \"That's the end of that.\"[164][165][166]  On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, \"You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan ... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State ... I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State.\"[167] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, \"here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam.\"[168]\n",

      "The Radcliffe Commission, dividing Bengal and Punjab, completed its work and reported to Mountbatten on 12 August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, not wanting to spoil the independence celebrations in both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of the Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the \"wrong side\" of the lines fled or were murdered, or murdered others, hoping to make facts on the ground which would reverse the commission's verdict.  Radcliffe wrote in his report that he knew that neither side would be happy with his award; he declined his fee for the work.[169]  Christopher Beaumont, Radcliffe's private secretary, later wrote that Mountbatten \"must take the blame—though not the sole blame—for the massacres in the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men, women and children perished\".[170] Jinnah did what he could for the eight million people who migrated to Pakistan; although by now over 70 and frail from lung ailments, he travelled across West Pakistan and personally supervised the provision of aid.[171] According to Ahmed, \"What Pakistan needed desperately in those early months was a symbol of the state, one that would unify people and give them the courage and resolve to succeed.\"[172]\n",

      "Jinnah speaking at the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 14 August 1947\n",
      "Among the restive regions of the new nation was the North-West Frontier Province. The referendum there in July 1947 had been tainted by low turnout as less than 10 per cent of the population were allowed to vote.[173] On 22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the elected government of Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan.[174] Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite him being a Kashmiri.[175] On 12 August 1948 the Babrra massacre in Charsadda occurred resulting in the death of 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement.[176]\n",
      "Along with Liaquat and Abdur Rab Nishtar, Jinnah represented Pakistan's interests in the Division Council to appropriately divide public assets between India and Pakistan.[177] Pakistan was supposed to receive one-sixth of the pre-independence government's assets, carefully divided by agreement, even specifying how many sheets of paper each side would receive. The new Indian state, however, was slow to deliver, hoping for the collapse of the nascent Pakistani government, and reunion.  Few members of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police Service had chosen Pakistan, resulting in staff shortages.  Partition meant that for some farmers, the markets to sell their crops were on the other side of an international border. There were shortages of machinery, not all of which was made in Pakistan. In addition to the massive refugee problem, the new government sought to save abandoned crops, establish security in a chaotic situation, and provide basic services. According to economist Yasmeen Niaz Mohiuddin in her study of Pakistan, \"although Pakistan was born in bloodshed and turmoil, it survived in the initial and difficult months after partition only because of the tremendous sacrifices made by its people and the selfless efforts of its great leader.\"[178]\n",
      "The princely states of India were advised by the departing British to choose whether to join Pakistan or India. Most did so prior to independence, but the holdouts contributed to what have become lasting divisions between the two nations.[179] Indian leaders were angered at Jinnah's attempts to convince the princes of Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bhopal and Indore to accede to Pakistan—the latter three princely states did not border Pakistan. Jodhpur bordered it and had both a Hindu majority population and a Hindu ruler.[180] The coastal princely state of Junagadh, which had a majority-Hindu population, did accede to Pakistan in September 1947, with its ruler's dewan, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, personally delivering the accession papers to Jinnah. But two of three vassal states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh—Mangrol and Babariawad—declared their independence from Junagadh and acceded to India. In response, the Nawab of Junagarh militarily occupied the two states. Subsequently, the Indian Army occupied the principality in November,[181] forcing its former leaders, including Bhutto, to flee to Pakistan, beginning the politically influential Bhutto family.[182]\n",

      "Jinnah's arrival at Lahore to discuss the Kashmir crisis in 1948\n",
      "The most contentious of the disputes was, and continues to be, that over the princely state of Kashmir. It had a Muslim-majority population and a Hindu maharaja, Sir Hari Singh, who stalled his decision on which nation to join. With the population in revolt in October 1947, aided by Pakistani irregulars, the maharaja acceded to India; Indian troops were airlifted in. Jinnah objected to this action, and ordered that Pakistani troops move into Kashmir. The Pakistani Army was still commanded by British officers, and the commanding officer, General Sir Douglas Gracey, refused the order, stating that he would not move into what he considered the territory of another nation without approval from higher authority, which was not forthcoming. Jinnah withdrew the order. This did not stop the violence there, which broke into the First India–Pakistan War.[179][183]\n",
      "Some historians allege that Jinnah's courting the rulers of Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are evidence of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states.[184] In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the hope the principle would be established for Kashmir.[185] However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely States where the ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference to the will of the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.[186][187] Despite the United Nations Security Council Resolution 47, issued at India's request for a plebiscite in Kashmir after the withdrawal of Pakistani forces, this has never occurred.[183] In January 1948, the Indian government finally agreed to pay Pakistan its share of British India's assets on 15 January 1948. The partition violence stopped by 18 January following the fast by Mahatma Gandhi with religious rioters promising Gandhi to frown upon the violence.[188] Only days later, on 30 January, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindutva activist, who claimed that Gandhi was pro-Muslim. After hearing about Gandhi's murder, Jinnah publicly made a brief statement of condolence, calling Gandhi \"one of the greatest men produced by the Hindu community\".[189] In February 1948, in a radio talk broadcast addressed to the people of the US,[190] Jinnah expressed his views regarding Pakistan's constitution to be in the following way:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Constitution of Pakistan is yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, I do not know what the ultimate shape of the constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a democratic type, embodying the essential principles of Islam. Today these are as applicable in actual life as these were 1300 years ago. Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy. It has taught equality of man, justice and fair play to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan.\n",
      "In March, Jinnah, despite his declining health, made his only post-independence visit to East Pakistan. In a speech before a crowd estimated at 300,000, Jinnah stated (in English) that Urdu alone should be the national language, believing a single language was needed for a nation to remain united. The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and in 1971 the official language issue was a factor in the region's secession to form the country of Bangladesh.[191]\n",
      "\n",
      "Illness and death\n",
      "Jinnah smoking a cigarette\n",
      "From the 1930s, Jinnah suffered from tuberculosis; only his sister and a few others close to him were aware of his condition. Jinnah believed public knowledge of his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that \"you must have read in the papers how during my tours ... I suffered, which was not because there was anything wrong with me, but the irregularities [of the schedule] and over-strain told upon my health\".[192][193] Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition.[194]  Fatima Jinnah later wrote, \"even in his hour of triumph, the Quaid-e-Azam was gravely ill ... He worked in a frenzy to consolidate Pakistan. And, of course, he totally neglected his health ...\"[195] Jinnah was a heavy smoker who worked with a tin of Craven \"A\" cigarettes at his desk, of which he had smoked 50 or more a day for the previous 30 years, as well as a box of Cuban cigars.  As his health got worse, he took longer and longer rest breaks in the private wing of Government House in Karachi, where only he, Fatima and the servants were allowed.[196] In June 1948, he and Fatima flew to Quetta, in the mountains of Balochistan, where the weather was cooler than in Karachi. He could not completely rest there, addressing the officers at the Command and Staff College saying, \"you, along with the other Forces of Pakistan, are the custodians of the life, property and honour of the people of Pakistan.\"[197] He returned to Karachi for the 1 July opening ceremony for the State Bank of Pakistan, at which he spoke. A reception by the Canadian trade commissioner that evening in honour of Canada's Dominion Day was the last public event he attended.[198]\n",
      "\n",
      "Jinnah spent many of the last days of his life at Quaid-e-Azam Residency, Ziarat, Pakistan.\n",
      "On 6 July 1948, Jinnah returned to Quetta, but at the advice of doctors, soon journeyed to an even higher retreat at Ziarat. Jinnah had always been reluctant to undergo medical treatment but realising his condition was getting worse, the Pakistani government sent the best doctors it could find to treat him. Tests confirmed tuberculosis, and also showed evidence of advanced lung cancer. He was treated with the new \"miracle drug\" of streptomycin, but it did not help. Jinnah's condition continued to deteriorate despite the Eid prayers of his people. He was moved to the lower altitude of Quetta on 13 August, the eve of Independence Day, for which a ghost-written statement for him was released.  Despite an increase in appetite (he then weighed just over 36 kilograms or 79 pounds), it was clear to his doctors that if he was to return to Karachi in life, he would have to do so very soon. Jinnah, however, was reluctant to go, not wishing his aides to see him as an invalid on a stretcher.[199] By 9 September, Jinnah had also developed pneumonia. Doctors urged him to return to Karachi, where he could receive better care, and with his agreement, he was flown there on the morning of 11 September. Dr Ilahi Bux, his personal physician, believed that Jinnah's change of mind was caused by foreknowledge of death. The plane landed at Karachi that afternoon, to be met by Jinnah's limousine, and an ambulance into which Jinnah's stretcher was placed. The ambulance broke down on the road into town, and the Governor-General and those with him waited for another to arrive; he could not be placed in the car as he could not sit up. They waited by the roadside in oppressive heat as trucks and buses passed by, unsuitable for transporting the dying man and with their occupants not knowing of Jinnah's presence. After an hour, the replacement ambulance came, and transported Jinnah to Government House, arriving there over two hours after the landing. Jinnah died later that night at 10:20 pm at his home in Karachi on 11 September 1948 at the age of 71, just over a year after Pakistan's creation.[200][201]\n",

But now there is no bitterness in my thought of him, only a great sadness for all that has been ... he succeeded in his quest and gained his objective, but at what a cost and with what a difference from what he had imagined.\"[202]\n",

      "Aftermath\n",
      "After Jinnah died, his sister Fatima asked the court to execute Jinnah's will under Shia Islamic law.[207] This subsequently became part of the argument in Pakistan about Jinnah's religious affiliation. Iranian-American academic Vali Nasr claimed that Jinnah \"was an Ismaili by birth and a Twelver Shia by confession, though not a religiously observant man.\"[208] In a 1970 legal challenge, Hussain Ali Ganji Walji claimed Jinnah had converted to Sunni Islam. Witness Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada stated in court that Jinnah converted to Sunni Islam in 1901 when his sisters married Sunnis. In 1970, Liaquat Ali Khan and Fatima Jinnah's joint affidavit that Jinnah was Shia was rejected. But in 1976 the court rejected Walji's claim that Jinnah was Sunni; effectively implying that he was a Shia. In 1984 a high court bench reversed the 1976 verdict and maintained that \"the Quaid was definitely not a Shia\", which suggested that Jinnah was Sunni.[209] According to the journalist Khaled Ahmed, Jinnah publicly had a non-sectarian stance and \"was at pains to gather the Muslims of India under the banner of a general Muslim faith and not under a divisive sectarian identity.\" Liaquat H. Merchant, Jinnah's grandnephew, writes that \"the Quaid was not a Shia; he was also not a Sunni, he was simply a Muslim\".[207] An eminent lawyer who practised in the Bombay High Court until 1940 testified that Jinnah used to pray as an orthodox Sunni.[210] According to Akbar Ahmed, Jinnah became a firm Sunni Muslim by the end of his life.[3]\n",

The rocky road to democracy in Pakistan and the relatively smooth one in India can in some measure be ascribed to Pakistan's tragedy of losing an incorruptible and highly revered leader so soon after independence.\"[215]\n",

      "His birthday is observed as a national holiday, Quaid-e-Azam Day, in Pakistan.[216] Jinnah earned the title Quaid-e-Azam (meaning \"Great Leader\"). His other title is Baba-e-Qawm (Father of the Nation). The former title was reportedly given to Jinnah at first by Mian Ferozuddin Ahmed. It became an official title by effect of a resolution passed on 11 August 1947 by Liaquat Ali Khan in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan.[217] Within a few days of Pakistan's creation Jinnah's name was read in the sermon at mosques as Amir ul-Millat, a traditional title of Muslim rulers.[210]\n",
      "The civil awards of Pakistan includes an 'Order of Quaid-i-Azam'. The Jinnah Society also confers the 'Jinnah Award' annually to a person that renders outstanding and meritorious services to Pakistan and its people.[218] Jinnah is depicted on all Pakistani rupee currency, and is the namesake of many Pakistani public institutions. The former Quaid-i-Azam International Airport in Karachi, now called the Jinnah International Airport, is Pakistan's busiest. One of the largest streets in the Turkish capital Ankara, Cinnah Caddesi, is named after him, as is the Mohammad Ali Jenah Expressway in Tehran, Iran. In Chicago, a portion of Devon Avenue was named \"Mohammed Ali Jinnah Way\". A section of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn, New York was also named 'Muhammad Ali Jinnah Way' in honour of the founder of Pakistan.[219] The Mazar-e-Quaid, Jinnah's mausoleum, is among Karachi's notable landmarks.[220] The \"Jinnah Tower\" in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India, was built to commemorate Jinnah.[221] The royalist government of Iran also released a stamp commemorating the centennial of Jinnah's birth in 1976. The Jinnah Mansion in Malabar Hill, Bombay, is in the possession of the Government of India, but the issue of its ownership has been disputed by the Government of Pakistan.[222] Jinnah had personally requested Prime Minister Nehru to preserve the house, hoping one day he could return to Bombay. There are proposals for the house to be offered to the government of Pakistan to establish a consulate in the city as a goodwill gesture, but Dina Wadia had also staked a claim on the property.[222][223]\n",

      "There is a considerable amount of scholarship on Jinnah which stems principally from Pakistan; in his 1969 book Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah : A Selected Bibliography, author Muhammad Anwar listed 1,500 entries, mostly in English, of books, articles and other publications published from 1948 to 1969.[224] According to Akbar S. Ahmed, it is not widely read outside the country and usually avoids even the slightest criticism of Jinnah.[225] According to Ahmed, some books published about Jinnah outside Pakistan mention that he consumed alcohol, but this is omitted from books published inside Pakistan. Ahmed suggests that depicting the Quaid drinking would weaken Jinnah's Islamic identity, and by extension, Pakistan's. Some sources allege he gave up alcohol near the end of his life.[84][226] The professor Maya Tudor concluded that \"Jinnah could not be described as a practicing Muslim\" given his  consumption of pork, use of alcohol, and usage of\n",
      "interest.[227] On the other hand, Yahya Bakhtiar, who observed Jinnah at close quarters, concluded that Jinnah was a \"very sincere, deeply committed and dedicated Mussalman.\"[210]\n",
      "According to historian Ayesha Jalal, while there is a tendency towards hagiography in the Pakistani view of Jinnah, in India he is viewed negatively.[228]  Ahmed deems Jinnah \"the most maligned person in recent Indian history ... In India, many see him as the demon who divided the land.\"[229]  Even many Indian Muslims see Jinnah negatively, blaming him for their woes as a minority in that state.[230] Some historians such as Jalal and H. M. Seervai assert that Jinnah never wanted the partition of India—it was the outcome of the Congress leaders being unwilling to share power with the Muslim League. They contend that Jinnah only used the Pakistan demand in an attempt to mobilise support to obtain significant political rights for Muslims.[231] Francis Mudie, the last British governor of Sindh, in Jinnah's honour once said:\n",
      "\n",
      "In judging Jinnah, we must remember what he was up against. He had against him not only the wealth and brains of the Hindus, but also nearly the whole of British officialdom, and most of the Home politicians, who made the great mistake of refusing to take Pakistan seriously. Never was his position really examined.[232][233]\n",
      "Muhammad Ali Jinnah, according to Yasser Latif Hamdani and Eamon Murphy, is associated with his call for Direct Action Day, which resulted in bloodshed and communal violence that culminated in the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan.[234] This incident and Jinnah's role, according to these authors, is viewed with contempt in India.[235][236]\n",
      "Jinnah has gained the admiration of Indian nationalist politicians such as Lal Krishna Advani, whose comments praising Jinnah caused an uproar in his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).[237] Indian politician Jaswant Singh's book Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence (2009) caused controversy in India.[238] The book was based on Jinnah's ideology and alleged that Nehru's desire for a powerful centre led to Partition.[239] Upon the book release, Singh was expelled from his membership of Bharatiya Janata Party, to which he responded that BJP is \"narrow-minded\" and has \"limited thoughts\".[240][241]\n",
      "Jinnah was the central figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, which was based on Jinnah's life and his struggle for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career.[242][243] The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is regarded as one of the best biographical books on Jinnah.[244]\n",
      "The view of Jinnah in the West has been shaped to some extent by his portrayal in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, Gandhi. The film was dedicated to Nehru and Mountbatten and was given considerable support by Nehru's daughter, the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi. It portrays Jinnah (played by Alyque Padamsee) in an unflattering light, who seems to act out of jealousy of Gandhi. Padamsee later stated that his portrayal was not historically accurate.[245] In a journal article on Pakistan's first governor-general, historian R. J. Moore wrote that Jinnah is universally recognised as central to the creation of Pakistan.[246] Stanley Wolpert summarises the profound effect that Jinnah had on the world:\n",
